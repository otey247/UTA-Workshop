0_breyers,LABEL READER,2020-04-17,2,EVER INCREASING INGEDIENTS LIST.,81,3,"Not the long ago Breyers set itself apart from other brands by using ONLY MILK, CREAM, SUGAR, and VANILLA in it's Vanilla ice cream. They went so far as to have TV commercials with children reading the ver very simple label. Now they show similar comercials stating the Breyers is made WITH those ingredients but no longer ONLY WITH. Read the label for yourself. The ice cream is still good but the longer ingrediants list ant the missing word ""ONLY"" hasn't gone unnoticed despite the attempt to gloss over the corporate decision to move away from the one distinctive characteristic that set the Breyers brand apart from the others."
0_breyers,AK in WA,2020-06-09,1,This is NO LONGER the Breyers We Used to Know,94,2,"I must agree with many one-star ratings here. The main beef is the huge change in your formula/ingredients. It's always been Breyers. When I first moved to the west coast, there was no Breyers, so I did not eat ice cream for several years. Then it's here ... in the past several years I've noticed: a) it no longer stays frozen long enough to eat it; b) when it melts, it forms into a scary gummy mess. Breyers used to melt and turn back into cream and milk basically. Why on earth would you decide to take a once delicious natural treat and load it up with a boatload of nasty chemicals that have RUINED YOUR PRODUCT?"
0_breyers,wing18,2020-09-29,2,Not as good as the natural they used to make!!,72,3,"This natural vanilla ice cream is not nearly as good as it used to be and I don't care for it any longer. Breyers needs to remove the vegetable gum from this ice cream in order for me to purchase this again. I do not like the texture that the vegetable gum gives to the ice cream. My local Pennsylvania Turkey Hill brand ice cream offers an all natural ice cream that is so much better than this version from Breyers. They do not put any fillers in their ice cream at all!!
I do not think that the quality of Breyers ice cream is bad by any means but not nearly as good as it could be if they used all natural ingredients.
Breyers, start making an all natural ice cream and I'll start buying your products again.
Sorry, but I'm just being honest."
0_breyers,sabrinas,2018-07-08,1,Better before,421,19,"Breyers natural vanilla used to be my holy Grail of ice cream. I believe I sent a laudatory email in 2003 or 2004 to specifically thank the company for their beautifully simple ingredients, and for not using stabilizers or emulsifiers since I find they give ice cream a strange mouth texture.
Imagine my disappointment when Breyers changed their formula to include stabilizers and consist of half air, and offer no product line like the original.
Imagine my irritation at seeing a Breyers commercial right now bragging about using real vanilla bean and their real, natural ingredients in ice cream. I came to check the ingredients list to see if I could start buying Breyers again, but you still list vegetable gum.
It's been years now, but you ruined my favorite ice cream, and despite the movement to real food, you haven't fixed it."
0_breyers,Scootonout,2018-09-27,1,Very disappointed,36,0,Bryers vanilla was the only ice cream I would eat. I loved the simple real ingredients and non chemical taste. However much to my dismay I had some ice cream tonight only to find that it was the equivalent to that of a Walmart generic ice cream. The ice cream is completely Flavorless too sugary and now has corn syrup and guar gum in it. . I won’t be buying this ice cream ever again!!! So much for being all natural. Who wants corn syrup in their food!
0_breyers,Donut,2019-01-11,1,"CORN SYRUP, TRANS FATS",141,9,"Breyers has changed their formula (natural vanilla). There are now 11 ingredients, not 5. The 4th ingredient is CORN SYRUP and there is also the addition of the cheap trans fat hidden ingredient, monoglycerides and diglycerides. Truly a disappointment since for decades BREYERS prided themselves on Pure and Simple ingredients. I see on there website, they still are. Look at the ingredients though. I will no longer buy their products. Dr. Donna~"
0_breyers,Jrad,2019-04-21,1,Very disappointed,75,1,"I noticed that the “Natural Vanilla” tastes different lately. I read the ingredients tonight’s and saw that Vegetable Gum is now one of the ingredients. There are other natural ice creams on the market that only use cream, sugar and vanilla. I will never purchase Bryers again unless you go back to using only natural and simple ingredients. Very disappointed."
0_breyers,JaretH,2018-09-03,2,They've ruined it.,22,0,"The flavor, texture and quality of Breyer's Natural Vanilla has declined remarkably over the past several years. Natural Vanilla was one of my family's favorites. While still good, it is no longer great. I find myself testing other brands in search of another ice cream that is similar to what Natural Vanilla used to be. I'm guessing the bean counters have worked their statistical wizardry, but it was never about price for my family."
0_breyers,Sigi1,2017-10-30,1,Almost all too creamy!,84,3,"Have been buying Bryers for 50 years but lately the taste has changed dramatically. Too creamy and gummy. I have tried all your vanilla varieties. They melt too quickly too. The Natural Vanilla seems closest to what ice cream used to be. Do not even want to finish an opened carton of Cherry Vanila I just bought. The ""ice"" part is gone; only some sweet gummy cream sauce is left."

Nothing about Bryers Natural Vanilla tastes artificial. It scoops easily from the first to the very last. Not overly sweetened, it leaves a fresh, clean feeling on your tongue that will have you wanting more. Its hard to practice moderation with an ice cream as perfect as this. The packaging is easily readable so you know what youre getting. The only downside to Bryers Natural Vanilla ice cream is that it doesnt come in a bottomless size!"
0_breyers,CraigK,2018-07-26,1,Major disappointment.,45,2,"This used to be the best vanilla ice cream on the planet. Now it's just inedible. I threw out an entire half gallon (CORRECTION: 1.5 quarts since the reduced the package size). This ice cream now has a chewy texture that is quite unpleasant. I've searched high and low for a natural vanilla bean ice cream that is the way Breyers used to be and I finally found Turkey Hill Vanilla Bean. Praise the lord, I'm saved."
0_breyers,FormerFan,2019-02-05,1,What did you do to my favorite vanilla ice cream?,23,0,"Breyers vanilla was once great. I remember when it would melt away on the palate, nothing but cream, milk and vanilla extract (with the vanilla bean flecks throughout). Now it's artificially enhance to make it ""creamy"" with gum, etc, leaving foam and an aftertaste. Yuck! I guess like so many things, it was too good. Maybe it's cheaper to produce now. Why couldn't it have been left as it was - perfect?"
0_breyers,meadowlynne,2020-08-16,1,What have you done to your ice cream?!!!,35,0,"I have literally bragged to everyone and even got people to convert to the best ice cream on the planet for as long as I can remember. I loved the snowy texture of the ice cream. It made it stand apart from all the rest. Especially the mint chip and vanilla bean! Now all the vanilla ice creams taste gummy and overly sweet. The texture is weird like a froth on the top of a latte only not in a good way. The biggest difference in the products is the added corn syrup. The reason we always turned to Breyers was to avoid it, not just because our family not doing well with it but because it's wayyy too sweet like its competitors.
PLEASE FIX YOUR ICE CREAM!!!!! Vow to get rid of the corn syrup from all your non commercial cookie and candy ice creams and with those to not add any to the actual ice cream. We've been loyal and we deserve our good stuff.
Here's a big one PLEASE do not use peanut ingredients in things that don't have peanuts! PLEASE remove it from the Rocky Road that I used to love and enjoy!"
0_breyers,castilloa,2020-08-16,1,The original was much better.,40,0,"I my whole family loved Breyers when I was a kid. The flavor and consistency was unique. Now with the added tara gum, it's too soft and watery. A shame that changed the recipe."
0_breyers,David,2019-09-06,1,Bummer,5,0,"Our family has been enjoying Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream for years, and truly loved every single bowl. The past 2 purchases of this product tasted very much like glue, so unfortunately we just can't buy any more - we threw the last one in away. Very sad to see this amazing product spiral into the dirt. If your tasting experts and product team found this to be an improvement, then they didn't do a proper survey of existing customers. We'll be looking for another brand, or asking our grocery store manager to add a Natural Ice Cream product."
0_breyers,rjrj,2017-07-19,3,breyers natural vanilla,73,4,used to be my very favorite vanilla ice cream. tasted the most like homemade without the fuss. now it has tara gum that gives it that gummy cheap store brand mouth feel and i may as well just by the cheaper brands.
0_breyers,jkmorris101,2018-08-28,1,Not the same as before,27,0,"I used to swear by the Natural Vanilla as the best ice cream, but not anymore!!! What a shame. Typical corporate move to increase profits at the cost of the quality of the product. No my Bryer's for me."
0_breyers,Real Ingredients,2018-09-02,1,Awful money grubbing company,30,1,"You ruined Breyer's ice cream with your gums, corn syrup, and cheap ingredients. Breyer's was one of my best food experiences in childhood and you destroyed it. Go back to simple ingredients, money hungry goblins. Why isn't ""ingredients"" in your list of ""what influences your purchase""?"
0_breyers,jh47,2018-08-16,1,Still fake,23,1,"Really disappointed...At Breyers growing up but I quit awhile. I decided to try it again after they touted Milk, Cream and Sugar but the taste and texture isn't ice cream......more like a warm version of thickening....ice cream shouldn't be light and fluffy.....it should be heavy and cold enough to give you a brain freeze...... not buying it again."
0_breyers,Poetic Justice,2018-06-24,1,Not Natural,32,1,What happened to the plain pure ingredients that made this the optimum choice for ice cream. Why have you change the receipt of such a great product? I will have to start making my own ice cream.
0_breyers,arturo6,2018-05-31,1,Addition of Gum,34,1,"The problem with Breyers, since purchased by a Canadian company, is the addition of gums to their icecream. I stopped purchasing once this was aded."
0_breyers,FloydK,2017-10-01,1,Not the Breyer's you remember,45,2,"I hadn't purchased Breyers ice cream in a while and had a taste for some ice cream so I picked some up. I remembered it as a high quality ice cream with a little lower butterfat than the super premium brands and a nice refreshing light pure flavor to it.
When I opened the package, I noticed that the ice cream had obviously melted and re-frozen somewhere along the supply chain. It was all frozen to one side of the container, strike one. Then I scooped it out, hmmm, the texture didn't seem quite right, it was soft and marshmallow like, strike two. Then I tasted it, ugh, awful. No flavor except sweet, all air, fluffy texture. This just didn't seem right, what's the problem? Then I checked the ingredients, yep, full of gums and stabilizers and with a butterfat content so low, they can't even call it ice cream any more. If it hadn't had the Breyer's name on it, I would have checked ingredients before purchase but I couldn't imagine that Unilever would take a great brand like Breyer's and completely destroy it, they did, strike three. It was so bad I threw the entire package away. If you are expecting the Breyer's from the past, you will be sadly disappointed."
0_breyers,Des1,2018-05-29,4,Disappointed about the ingredients change,45,3,"The taste of Breyer's vanilla ice cream declined when the ingredients changed to include gum and added flavoring. Vanilla ice cream ought to consist of only milk/cream, sugar and vanilla beans (or extract)."
0_breyers,Meme,2018-04-15,2,Dissapointed,19,0,I am disappointed to discover they added vegetable gum. I bought Breyers for its purity. I no longer like the texture. And it no longer tastes like old fashioned real ice cream. It's very disappointing.
0_breyers,BettyCrocker2,2018-01-10,1,Flavorless,33,1,This product has absolutely NO flavor. Breyer's natural vanilla was my favorite ice cream of all time. Not anymore. What happened?
0_breyers,KarenM,2019-02-20,1,So disappointed! You ruined a classic!,11,0,"I grew up eating Breyers Vanilla ice cream. I loved the vanilla bean specks, the creaminess, how it took some effort to scoop out of the container, the puddle of cream left as it melted in the bowl. I haven't had any in years, and wanted some for the past few weeks. Finally picked some up today at the grocery store. So disappointed! The first difference I noticed was the texture. My freezer gets really cold, and I expected to have a tough time scooping it out at first. Nope! It was like fluff. Scooped right out like marsh mellow cream. Bad sign. Then, I tasted it. I couldn't finished my bowl. Gone was the decadent texture, and the flavor changed too. Less rich somehow. I'm sure Breyers has some ""market trends, cost, taste test"" answer to this, but I really don't care. You had great ice cream for decades and you ruined it. Never buying it again, unless you take out the tara gum and go back to your classic recipe."
0_breyers,little v,2020-04-14,4,Please add a reduced sugar version!,0,0,"When i'm craving vanilla icecream, I still go to Breyers Natural Vanilla icecream. However, i noticed this past time how overly sweet it is. And i'm not a fan of brands claiming 'Sugar free' or 'No sugar added' because i don't like the ingredients put in to fake the sweet flavor. A lot of other brands like Lays potato chips have a reduced sodium version, chobani flips has a reduced sugar version, could breyers come out with that happy medium for those like me who still want real sugar, but not 14 added grams per serving! I'm sure it would taste just as good, if not better! I would definitely indulge and buy this product more frequently if so!"

Wake up, people!"
0_breyers,Unilever sucks,2018-07-02,2,Natural Vanilla?,11,0,What are the cows fed? Grass? GMO Corn? Why don't the ingredients say Vanilla? Is it actually Vanillian? (wood pulp) Is that why you can say natural ingredients? Unilever bought Ben & Jerry's and ruined them to. Now you can only eat ice cream you make yourself.
0_breyers,Randolph,2018-11-18,1,Corn Syrup? Really?,13,0,"Sad to see a brand with integrity sell out for the few bucks saved by using corn syrup. Good bye after decades of loyalty, I've moved on to Turkey Hill."
0_breyers,Prof Cannabidoid,2019-08-09,1,Bring back Natural Vanilla w/ Vanilla Bean Specks,5,0,"This ""new"" flavor of vanilla completely misses the mark when it comes to a true vanilla bean flavor. I bought this flavor thinking it was the ""old"" flavor of vanilla (Natural Vanilla with vanilla bean specks.) This flavor has absolutely no hint of true vanilla. Frankly, it is horrible and not any better than any run-of-the-mill superstore-grade vanilla ice cream, except for it's lack of diglycerides. Breyers, please bring back the Natural Vanilla with Vanilla Bean Specks!"
0_breyers,DisappointedToo,2020-01-31,1,Unilever ruined Breyers,3,0,"Seems when Breyer's sold out to Unilever years ago the brand was heavily cheapened. Most ice cream makers have started adding gum to their product to stabilize it during shipping. Unfortunately it makes the ice cream unbearable to the tongue. It's nothing like real ice cream any more. Breyer's has succumbed to industry trends rather than maintaining a quality product that we all came to love and support.
I personally never minded paying a little more money for a quality product. They've cheapened it and shrunken the container portion, yet still charge a hefty price.
The only brands I have found that still make real ice cream are Hagan Daz and Turkey Hill. And Blue Bunny Vanilla, but it comes in a plastic container. So I won't buy it."
0_breyers,Spgreig,2020-07-08,1,No specks,2,0,I’m upset that both 1.5Qt containers of the “Natural Vanilla” from two different stores both lacked the little black specks I have come to love and expect.

0_breyers,Jimmy,2020-04-04,1,Way too sweet,4,0,"I rarely eat ice cream these days but bought this just to have around for the occasional indulgence. Breyer’s used to be our standard way back so this was the logical choice. I tried a spoonful and was immediately turned off by how over the top sweet it was to the point it doesn’t taste like ice cream. It’s now in the sink melting so I can flush it down the toilet.
Visiting your website I see you have a no added sugar version. Why add any in the first place?
Very disappointed."
0_breyers,No agar gum,2020-06-13,5,Try turkey hill all natural,21,2,I had the same issue with breyers. I finally found turkey hill all natural ice cream. Don’t settle for fillers. Eat natural
0_breyers,G S S,2019-06-18,1,Recipe Ruined by Tara Gum,4,0,"The Natural Vanilla recipe change to include Tara Gum changes the texture and more importantly, the flavor in negative ways. The previous rich and creamy vanilla flavor profile now has an “off” taste that takes away the previously perceptible vanilla beans. This was previously the go-to ice cream. Now? I tried for a while but I will not be buying again and will find a better replacement without the funky gum flavor until at least the classic recipe comes back as an option."
0_breyers,MelC,2019-02-06,1,When Did You Change the Ingredients???,8,0,I haven't purchased this product in awhile and was so surprised today to find out that you had cheapened the ingredients.

0_breyers,Sabine,2019-02-05,1,Frozen Dairy Dessert & Corn Syrup?,7,0,"Boy, was I surprised when I got my Bryers home only to discover it is a “frozen dairy dessert“, not even ice cream, and that the second ingredient is corn syrup. Will not be purchasing it again. Much different from what Breyers used to stand for."
0_breyers,Louis,2020-08-14,1,Deceptive Packaging,0,0,"I sent a co worker to purchase vanilla ice cream for an office event. The Breyers Natural Vanilla was on the shelf with all the Breyers ice creams. She quickly grabbed 4 containers of the Natural Vanilla. To our surprise when serving this was badically ice milk. It totally ruined the cake it was served with. We all looked at the container to see the front of the container listed cream, sugar and milk. However, the actual ingredients on the side says the ingredient (largest ingredient) was milk! The thin icy cosistency was not what was expected. Breyers needs better packaging to identify what the product is, ice milk."
0_breyers,PreferItClean,2018-12-26,1,Don't like the flavor and texture changes,11,0,"I am interested in the flavoring components used. I notice that the ingredients list does not mention vanilla beans or vanilla, only ""natural flavors"". There is a statement on the box about the characteristics of the vanilla used (which are good), and it states that all the flavors used are ""natural"", but that all leaves it pretty obvious that there are other flavoring agents besides vanilla...
I have heard that a common component in ice cream nowadays are ingredients coming from non-vegetable sources, such as ground-up beetle shells. Do you also include non-vegetable sourced flavoring agents in Breyer's Natural Vanilla?
Regarding the review titled ""Better before"", I must agree with this reviewer. There was a day when you advertised the vanilla bean specks, and you could really see them; not so much any more. But that's not the main issue. The flavor was much better back then; Breyer's was the only manufacturer with a vanilla ice cream that had good flavor, from my perspective, but not since you changed your recipe. I still like the mint chocolate chip ice cream -- it is one of my favorites -- but you lost me with the vanilla. I don't even like it on top of pie anymore, much less by itself.
Then, on top of the flavor changes you made, you are gunking it up with gum.
That has been very disappointing. I don't know why you thought you had to change the recipe, much less stick with the change. Coca-Cola, back in the day when they came up with their new Coke at least had the sense to go back to their classic recipe.
I don't recommend your vanilla to anyone anymore. I used to recommend it all the time."

It was even kept in the natural food freezer, not with the other, regular ice creams. Then you started adding Tara, vegetable gum. It totally changed the homemade texture. I understand that many people prefer the creamy texture of other ice creams and allows more air to be mixed into the ice cream, making it fluffier. It also allows you to put less ice cream into the container. I noticed that this new recipe creates a lighter product (weight wise). I prefer the icy hand cranked texture. It even melts differently now. If I left it on the counter a bit too long, and it melted a bit, the melted ice cream would still be edible when it re froze. Not any more. It melted differently in your mouth even. I’m sad to say I will be hand cranking my ice cream from now on. You gave me and my family a few years of the absolute perfect ice cream!"

0_breyers,Daniel,2020-03-22,2,"Awesome tasting, recently changed",2,0,Breyers natural vanilla has been my go-to ice cream for years on account of the fact that I'm allergic to basically every other brands ice cream except for a couple. Recently they stopped including vanilla bean in it or at least this last carton I bought did not have vanilla bean in it. This is a huge mistake on their part if this is a permanent change. The actual vanilla bean parts and ice cream give it a unique taste and make it way better in my opinion.
0_breyers,Anonymous,2020-02-10,1,Why would they do something so dumb?,2,0,"I always bought the Natural Vanilla, because it was simply milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla. They did a big ad campaign around that at one point. Why would you add gum to that? They have a handful of different vanillas. Why not leave this one alone and keep the customers who wanted that? I was especially annoyed that there was not notice of it. I just looked one day for some reason. Anyway, yuck. No reason to ever buy Breyers again."

Breyers natural flavor vanilla ice cream has no intense vanilla flavor. It is very flat. It is no longer a quality ice cream. Real vanilla beans are very expensive. Try pricing them at your grocery store. I understand why they are not using them anymore, but their advertising is very deceptive.

0_breyers,Oceana,2019-09-12,1,They ruined my favorite ice cream,2,0,I was shocked to see that gum is now added to the natural vanilla. I don't care if it is a vegetable based product. I read the reasoning behind adding it to the customer service responses but I am not impressed. We loved the Breyer's Naturals line because it had simple ingredients and no gum. It was creamy enough without the gum and the formation of ice crystals with temperature fluctuations means it is real ice cream! Listen to your customers. Take the gum out. Maybe you are starting to use inferior ingredients to cut costs and have to add gum to compensate but are using this lame excuse to justify it in the mix. I have been eating Breyer's vanilla with vanilla bean since I could eat ice cream. You slowly ruined all of my other favorite flavors like butter pecan with garbage ingredients that make my whole family sick. Now we have had to switch to Haagen Dazs or making my own. My dad can get Turkey Hill vanilla where he lives and that still has no gums.

And he cannot find anywhere what I am telling him I want Breyers Vanilla Bean ice cream. He tells me he cannot find it in any of the grocers where we live. Then I happen to remember the name change several years back so I go to Breyers.com. Imagine my disappointment reading a lot of the reviews since the change. Now I’m almost afraid to tell him to keep looking now that I know the correct name. It seems the true lovers of that old fashion, families gathered under huge oak trees and everyone taking turns to crank that old turn crank ice cream maker, kids skipping around waiting impatiently sticking their fingers in the ice to taste the salt to finally taste that impeccable creamy, sweet, with specks of something that made that white cold frozen dessert taste like heaven. That’s what the old version of Breyers Vanilla Bean ice cream tasted like to me. Old fashioned turn crank ice cream. I would dip it out as frozen scoops but stir and stir it till it became the creamy smooth specialty that always brought me those memories. Why oh why did you have to mess with something so perfect."

0_breyers,Norty12,2019-02-05,2,Loved it so much it almost gave me type 2 diabetes,0,1,"Because of the natural ingredients I used to regularly blend one or two scoops of natural vanilla ice cream with a banana, a cup of milk and sometimes a teaspoon of malt powder for what I regarded as a simple nutritious and delicious dessert. Then I was diagnosed with borderline type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. Between the fructose in the banana and the sugar in the ice cream itself, I was simply consuming too much sugar. I have had to eliminate ice cream completely and reduce my consumption of ripe bananas to avoid getting diabetes. I also use lower glycemic natural sweeteners like agave instead of sugar. Perhaps you could reformulate your natural vanilla ice cream with agave instead of sugar for people like me who need to reduce their consumption of sugar."

I assume Breyers knows this—thus the name change to “frozen dairy dessert” (whatever this means). The Vanilla tastes like it was produced in a laboratory......straight out of a beaker. Such a shame.

BUT our favorite way is to put it in a mug add Pepsi and stir. It’s like a Pepsi shake and is awesome. It doesn’t taste right with any other vanilla but the Natural. So yum in this heat"
0_breyers,alyssam14,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"Delicious creamy ice by one of my favorite ice cream brands. The vanilla taste is strong and fulfills your taste buds. Can be used with mix ins, toppings, to make sundaes, root beer floats, banana splits, shakes and so much more. Definitely a staple you must have in your house at all times."
0_breyers,sherip51d0,2019-06-03,5,,0,0,"My kiddo's favourite ice cream, it makes the best rootbeer floats, banana splits and milkshakes!

0_breyers,jenniferma9a4,2020-09-22,5,,0,0,Silky smooth heaven is what this is!  I want a bowl of it juat thinking about it.

A classic go to with a great flavour

0_breyers,ericm14,2020-06-12,4,,0,0,Its a decent vanilla flavor. I am an ice cream fiend but honestly dont care too much about quality or consistency. Breyers is a fairly cheap ice cream and gets the job done but if youre looking for quality this is on the lower end.

I switched to lactose free milk and it has made a big Difference. So when I signed up for this campaign I was thinking maybe I would try the frozen yogurt. I don't really care for frozen yogurt. I figured since it was a Bryers product that way it would taste real good. When I went to the market to get ice cream I noticed that Bryer has a lactose free vanilla so I pick that up instead. I loved it best of all no stomach ache! I can enjoy ice cream again I love putting strawberries and whipped cream on top. I'm going to go back and check to see if they have different flavors I didn't have the time to go to the case to look to see if they had chocolate or other flavors. Even if they don't at least I can eat the vanilla and add stuff that I like to the top like M&Ms and chocolate syrup and feel like I can have a nice ice cream sundae again. Thank you for the opportunity because I don't think I would have made a special effort to go look."

0_breyers,Kateybee,2017-07-26,5,Real ingredients= real quality,0,1,"Our family is filled with ice cream junkies. From the 14 year old purist who wants straightforward ice cream to my husband who would happily combine twenty flavors in a Frankenstein concoction, to myself and the 11 year old who fall somewhere in the middle, we all love ice cream and have strong feelings about it. Add to the mix our new baby. At eight months old we don't want him kissing out on the yumminess, but I'm also especially strict about what he eats. So far he hadn't been given any ice cream in his short life. But when I read the ingredients on Breyers Naturally Vanilla ice cream I knew he would be getting his first taste! When presented with bowls of ice cream for dessert, each of the older family members went at it in their own way, toppings went on in handfuls, sprinkles, or were avoided entirely. Each of us proclaimed the smooth, direct flavor of the ice cream to be perfect as we ate. Meanwhile, the baby watched with intensity. As his small spoon was filled with ice cream his legs and arms went wild! Surely whatever was making the rest of his family so happy must be good. His tiny mouth closed around the spoonful of creamy deliciousness and immediately his eyes lit up. This had been worth the wait! If he could have jumped out of the high chair to get more into his mouth faster he surely would have! Overall, the whole family agreed that Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream is the purest, smoothest ice cream we've had. The flavor manages to be both intense and light at the same time. Perfection."

1_breyers,MO Family,2019-04-28,1,Guar gum or Tara gum stabilizers no thanks!,9,3,I used to love Brewers Ice Cream until you added junk to it. Turkey Hill Natural has taken your place in our house for many years now. We only buy breyers in a pinch now when we can’t get Turkey Hill
1_breyers,Armando,2019-01-13,1,New recipe is terrible.,6,2,I remember when this used to be the most amazing vanilla I've ever tried. It was natural and tasted homemade. Bring back the original recipes...limited edition and test it out. There's a market for that.
1_breyers,Icecreamnerd,2017-10-30,2,Not any home I've been to,15,11,While it was sort of creamy....it was bland as all get out. Tasted like they forgot the vanilla....and that was a definite turn off for me. The dog got the rest of the container after my initial bowl.

1_breyers,Kimono,2020-07-21,5,Best actual homemade flavor!,1,0,This is the only ice cream I buy because you can do anything with a great vanilla flavor. This one is just sweeter and creamy compared to French vanilla and other brands.
1_breyers,Lindalee,2020-05-06,1,No Vanilla!,1,1,"I remember when any flavor of Breyers was the best ice cream made! It was just milk, cream, sugar, real vanilla and chocolate. Now, guar gum, tara gum (what on earth is *that*?) And mono glycerides. No thanks, Breyers. Turkey Hill All-Natural is what I buy now. So much better than Breyers, and I'm sorry to say that because I've bought Breyers for 60 years!"
1_breyers,NeverAgain,2020-04-13,1,Taste Like Nothing,1,1,"Bought this by mistake when at the grocery store thinking I got Vanilla flavored ice cream. I was so wrong, it taste nothing like Vanilla. If I were to describe it it would be, Cream and Artificial ingredients.
It taste like cheap ice cream that forgot to put flavor into it."
1_breyers,chelseat35,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"I like vanilla ice cream but I don’t generally buy it, I tend to go for other flavors. However there is something about this ice cream that I just love. The homemade part really makes a huge difference in the taste and if you like vanilla, definitely give this a try and I guarantee you’ll love it. Make sure to get the homemade and not the natural, they look the same and it can be confusing."

Thanks for making this..."

1_breyers,midcenturymame,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,MMMMMmmm there is no substitute for this Vanilla ice cream. It's creamy goodness. Soothing your throat and taste buds as slides down your throat. Cools you down and disrupts the acid build up laying in your stomach for good sleeping at night. Tea and Ice cream a Lovely Combination. I just wish Breyers would come out with a Vanilla Tea flavor!
1_breyers,rylic,2020-09-22,5,,0,0,This is a great vanilla ice cream! It’s made with real ingredients so you aren’t getting all those added preservatives! I definitely prefer the homemade vanilla to the vanilla bean or regular vanilla! It seems much creamier to me! It’s great for eating as a sundae or root beer float or if you prefer it alone it’s great too!

At the grocery store, I couldn't wait to get it home to try, especially because it is made of fresh cream and rich cocoa, which sounds yummy, and it is! I loved the sweet creamy taste so much that I shared it with my family, and they all loved it, too, and asked for more! I feel good about serving this delightful ice cream to my family because it contains no growth hormones! I highly recommend Breyers ice cream!"

I find that I use Her here ice cream to ""reward"" myself for staying true to my healthy eating rule as well as when I don't eat that extra helping of whatever is appealing to my taste buds at the time.
I let myself eat a bowl of Breyers Chocolate(my favorie) e,tra creamy 1vs a week for good behavior.
I look forward to it so much I find it isn't as difficult for me is I know what's waiting for me at the end of the week.=)

3_breyers,Dee Jae,2018-07-16,5,Finally! Real Chocolate Flavor!!,10,1,"When it comes to store-bought ice cream, I think Breyers is the best. But due to my experience with most all ""chocolate"" flavored ice cream, store-bought or chain-bought, I usually just steer away from it. I've nearly never have been able to find a truly chocolate-tasting ice cream anywhere. So even though I love Breyers Ice Cream, I still never bought their chocolate ice-cream because I didn't want to be disappointed. But boy, was I so wrong!
Breyers' Chocolate Ice Cream has the most exceptionally chocolate flavor I can find outside of my favorite ice-cream-on-a-stick at the county fair. It's so creamy and not too sweet. I'm glad I took the plunge. And thanks so much, Breyers, for meeting my crazy chocolate NEED."

It was really good!! I'm not sure that I would spend $5 on this product in the future when there are typically several other ice creams on sale right next to it; however, if it is on sale I will definitely purchase Breyers gelato in the future. It had a nice creamy texture and I loved the sweet ribbon of cinnamon throughout the gelato. It's not as rich and creamy as Ben & Jerry's but also has a fraction of the fat."

There is no taste, weight, mouth feel, or otherwise resembleds the old 1980s Real Bryers ice cream. Why o why did you change it? Is it cost? Just make smaller sizers and sell them for a profit! Now it is impossible to get real ice cream in America, this is not good. I’m super disappointed, I feel like the label said all natural ice cream and it’s only 1% ice cream if that. I feel like I just wasted $8 sorry Bryers, you were the last Hope America had for real ice cream."

A self-proclaimed chocoholic, I will admit that I usually add chocolate toppings to chocolate ice cream for an added fix, but this ice cream doesn't even need it. Its rich chocolate flavor and creamy texture stand alone, no toppings required. It scoops easily (there is nothing worse than fighting to get the ice cream out of the container), and I was already planning my second bowl before my first one was done. Bonus: It is made from non-rBST-treated cows and non-GMO sourced ingredients, so you can enjoy it guilt-free."

3_breyers,Bull Island,2017-07-05,5,True chocolate!,2,0,"I enjoy LOTS of ice cream. Almost exclusively chocolate. I would like to think I can tell the difference between good vs. excellent ice cream choices. Breyers chocolate is among the best affordable choices available. However, I believe that the formula has been changed at least twice in the past, though I have no evidence other than my sense of taste. Before extra creamy chocolate was available, I was slightly disappointed with the intensity of chocolate in Breyers chocolate ice cream. But, AFTER extra creamy was offered, I believe the regular chocolate recipe changed--making for a much improved offering that continues to the present. I had sort of given up on Breyers chocolate until a few months ago. I'd moved to another region of the USA and was ""desperate"" for some chocolate ice cream. I did not find my usual brand so I gave Breyers chocolate another try and LIKED it!! I now find that familiar generous chocolate flavor and density I recall from some time previous. Keep up the good work Breyers!"

3_breyers,merchantqueen,2017-09-06,5,Yummy in the tummy,0,0,This is the perfect ice cream for the ice cream snobs. I picked up the Black Raspberry Chocolate but it was a tough choice between that and the heath bar crunch one. It's rich and creamy flavor with dark chocolate chips lightly dotted among rich swirls of raspberry is so delicious it's a festival for your taste buds. Black Raspberry is one of my favorite flavors and I was hesitant about it having chocolate bits in it but it's not drowning in them and instead are a nice touch and addition to raspberry flavor. I give this 5 thumbs up.

3_breyers,Mia78,2019-07-24,2,Used to love chocolate,1,1,So dissapointed to find out that some of the ingredients are not natural or good for you. What happened? Did you change the recipe? Use to taste better too and you no longer sell the 3 chocolates that you used to. You shouldn't add carrageenan and natural flavor. Bad for you and didn't check all other ingredients. Lease go back to basic recipe that is better for you and what you advertise because now it's somewhat false advertising.

3_breyers,izaunicorn,2020-05-02,4,,0,0,Breyer's Chocolate has a decent chocolate flavour. It's more of a milk chocolate ice cream. One thing I would love to see them do for their chocolate line would be to offer either a milk and dark chocolate swirl ice cream or a dark chocolate ice cream for a bolder chocolate flavour.

4_breyers,Sabrina,2017-07-27,1,Where is the strawberry flavor?,18,10,"The first time I thought it was a fluke, a bad run, not enough strawberries in the mix. But I have purchased the strawberry ice cream three or four times this summer, each time hoping a new crop of strawberries would have somehow made it into the mix, but alas the ice cream is as bland as ever. Where is the strawberry flavor? Did the price of strawberries go up so you had to use as few as possible and still qualify as ""strawberry""?
And creaminess? That's gone too. But one good thing, is that certain flavors - alas, not all - vanilla , chocolate, the disappointing strawberry, are made with only a few ingredients and contain no corn syrup."

I only purchased it once and was and very happy to see the NON GMO logo,(as I am highly sensitive otherwise) only that the logo depicts a ""Bee"" instead of the ""Butterfly"" which is supposed to be an authentic Logo for Non Gmo and that concerns me a little. All in all I can attest that it is Non Gmo so far, as I have NOT had any reactions, thank goodness. Would be great to find some kind of cheese also Non GMO."

Don't get me started on Friendlys and Turkey Hill. This is the best of the best. I hate to admit I went on strike for a few years when they moved from Philadelphia.

I hope you guys can fix this."
5_breyers,PreferItClean,2018-12-25,5,"refreshing light feel, wonderful chocolate",2,0,"I'm glad that this ice cream hasn't been ruined with the gunk. The light feel in the mouth of this ice cream is so wonderfully refreshing, and of course the mint is part of that.
I'm curious about the reviewer who thinks that there be too many chips in this ice cream. I love the abundance! And the chocolate is so wonderfully chocolaty, not sweet, and its texture is wonderfully creamy its temperature not be exceedingly cold.
I could agree with the reviewer who wished it wouldn't be as sweet; I think 60-80% of the sugar would make it even better.
Breyers Mint chocolate chip is one of my three top ice creams of any brand."
5_breyers,Stephysand,2019-04-03,4,Creamy goodness!,6,0,I had the pleasure of being able to try the Breyer's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream. It was a big hit at my son's birthday party! The taste was delicious after I got over it not being green. My favorite part was it not having any GMO's in it. That is what I talked the most about with family and friends. The kids loved it and couldn't believe it was mint because of it not being green. Who would have thought a color would make you think twice before trying something. I tell you though it's definitely worth it. It has a nice creamy texture not overly minty and a good amount of chocolate chips in it. I would definitely buy it again and a few friends have already gotten some after trying it at the party.

The mint ice cream is creamy with just the right amount of mintiness. I could do without quite so many chocolate chips and agree with another reviewer the chip-to-ice cream ratio is a bit too much. I would love to see a mint ice cream with a ribbon of chocolate instead of the chips. I love the semi-sweet chocolate flavor but crunching the chips grind the chocolate into my teeth too much.

This mint chocolate chip ice cream has a real good flavor too it, not too faint, but not overpowering. It is very creamy and smooth and filled with plenty of chocolate chips.

It's a perfect flavor for a warm summer night. It's nice to snack on alone, or would even pair well with a vanilla or chocolate cake. I would purchase again, especially if I were planning to have friends over - seems like a great crowd pleaser of a flavor!"

The texture was okay, and they were very generous with the chocolate chips. However, that's where it ends. The flavor was very mild mint. I did not get that nice cooling, refreshing taste. It tasted more like vanilla than mint ice cream. I even double-checked the box to be sure I did in fact purchase mint. Yep. Also, the chips were hard and not melty. I had to chew each chip instead of having them melt in my mouth. I guess I will be going back to Hood ice cream or some other brand. When I buy MINT chocolate chip ice cream, I expect it to have a strong minty flavor. Too bad, Breyers, you used to be good years ago. You have lost a customer."

It's creamy tasting mint with chocolate chip chunks that are incredibly satisfying. It doesn't have that green fluorescent coloring and it's just superb. It reminds me of an Andes after dinner mint & I love it. Beware; It's very hard not to eat the whole container in 1 sitting.

There were a few Breyers flavors left that were basic ingredients and didn't have that unsatisfying bland gelatinous texture that ruins most yogurts and ice creams. Also, it seems less minty! I'd always preferred Breyers mint for the refreshing mint level. The good news is it'll be better for my health because in writing this I realize I probably eat too much ice cream. If your chocolate has also changed to crap ingredients that'll be a good step towards my desire to eat less sugar. Thank you."

I’ve been thinking about it all day especially after a 12 hour shift and when presented with the ice cream I was oddly disappointed to see that the ice wasn’t that iconic mint green. When I went to taste it I again was disappointed when I didn’t get that big burst of mint flavor. It was there but nothing that made me want more. Was completely dissatisfied... Breyer ice creams are usually good but not this time it seems.

5_breyers,redrig,2017-07-17,5,Great Summer Treat,0,0,"The Breyers Mint Chocolate Chip is so refreshing on a warm summer night. It has a nice, mellow minty taste, not overpowering. And it isn't that weird green color like other mint chocolate chip ice cream I've had. The chips are a good size and are dark chocolate which is a great complement to the mint flavor. I had myself a nice 1/2 cup serving and didn't have to blow my ""points"" allowance for the day ;-)
I like the fact that Breyers is natural and the non-GMO is right on the label. I can pronounce every ingredient on the label, which is nice.
I also didn't have to break my scoop trying to get it out of the container. It wasn't hard as a rock; it had a nice, smooth, creamy consistency. I would highly recommend trying any of the Breyers; I plan on checking out their Ice Cream Cake flavor next!"

I asked around and found out a lot of friends were also just spitting out the chips and wishing for an only mint flavor. Breyers, could you please offer Mint without chocolate please? ❤️"
5_breyers,Ice Cream Aficionado 99,2020-02-14,5,Ridiculously good. Ate a whole bucket yesterday :(,0,0,"I really love this ice cream. It is creamy, has just the right amount of mint flavour and just has an overall high quality, rich and tasty ingredients feel and flavour in all the right places. The chocolate bits are super rich and decadent and placed just perfectly throughout the ice cream. To make this even more ridiculously decadent, I often put tons of chocolate syrup on top and have it with an espresso....heavenly! Can't recommend enough."
5_breyers,MeShell,2018-02-18,1,Breyers Mint Chocolate Chip disappointing,0,0,"Where are the chocolate chips in the mint ice cream? Literally, I could take 7-10 bites without one. The mint ice cream was delicious, bur the complementary flavor of chocolate was almost non-existent. This used to be my favorite ice cream. I had not eaten it in a while and decided to go back to it. I'm so very disappointed. I am going to try it one more time in the hopes it was a fluke error."
5_breyers,Boschmom,2017-07-29,5,Breyers Mint Chocolate Chip,0,0,"I've eaten several different flavors of Breyers ice cream, some of them are better than others and some aren't even worth buying. In the past I've found some of the flavors to be somewhat watery and unflavorful... Breyers definitely doesn't disappoint with their mint chocolate chip though. It's creamy, flavorful and healthier than most other brands. I'll be buying this again for my family."
5_breyers,sposies,2017-07-18,5,Yum! Like I remember,0,0,Breyers mint chip was my favorite when I was a kid. It's still really good. It's not super sweet and the mint is refreshing. I think the mint could be stronger though. The texture is creamy and enjoyable. The chocolate chips are crispy. The chips are not evenly distributed throughout the container. The top of the container had a lot fewer chips than the middle. Still wicked good!
5_breyers,MollyGrace,2020-09-13,2,Changed Ingredients to Crap,0,0,"This used to be my favorite flavor. Growing up, the ingredients were just sugar, milk, cream, vanilla flavor, and mint flavor. No additives what so ever. Now, there are all of these gums, and processed things. Breyers was the only ice cream I would eat. BECAUSE IT WASN’T CRAP. Now, I’m never going to buy it again. I just learned these ingredients were added and I am dissatisfied."
5_breyers,Sailingsoon,2018-11-25,1,Bad Batch?,0,0,"We have purchased this icream in the past and it was good. This time the mint flavor was overpowering and sickening. Even the grandchild, who normally devours this ice cream, took one bite and gave it back. Byers appears to have a quality control problem judging from the variance in mint flavor and chocolate chips that other reviewers have complained about."
5_breyers,Tmorao,2020-08-01,1,Worst Mint Chip,0,0,"Mint Chocolate Chip is the family's favorite flavor and Breyer's is our favorite brand however, these two don't mix! Why is the chocolate so big with a waxy texture? You have to chew and chew on the pieces, it's annoying. I wish the chocolate could be perfected like (you know who, 31 flavors), if it was more like that we would definitely buy all the time!"
5_breyers,suzannepa79b,2019-03-11,5,,0,0,"No doubt the best mint chocolate chip ice cream made is from Breyers. No other brand even comes close.

6_breyers,Christopher1965,2020-03-09,3,False Advertisement,3,1,"I’ve been buying Breyer’s ice cream all my life. One of the greatest treats my mother and father could give me was buying your Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry ice-cream, but my most recent purchase of this product proved most questionable as to your standards. The “Natural Vanilla” was no more than your generic store brand vanilla with no vanilla beans. The chocolate and strawberry tasted subpar to the product you normally produce; the chocolate lacked a strong coco flavor, but still maintained a full body. The strawberry also seemed less flavorful, but also maintained its expected body. My primary grievance is the quality drop in your vanilla ice cream. You advertise Natural Vanilla but are no longer producing."
6_breyers,Cdo80,2018-07-25,5,Best ice cream in the world,8,0,I grew up on this. My parents always kept a container of the Neopolitan in the freezer. As good as it’s always been

You can’t go wrong with traditional Neapolitan ice cream as it has a little something for everyone. I especially like this because of the strawberry ice cream; I love it, but my family could take it or leave it. By having the other options, I don’t have to feel guilty about buying a whole half gallon of the same flavor. Breyer’s products are creamy and are made from natural ingredients, so the flavor can’t be beat!"

The last three boxes of the vanilla, chocolate, strawberry were not up to standard. The most obvious problem was visually apparent when the top cane off. Right there is the picture on the lid and the actual product. Lid-lots of strawberries... ice cream virtually no strawberries (see photo).
This photo has remained unchanged. The cream has not."

Sure Breyers has a more natural ingredient list, but it loses as far as consistency, taste, and added sugar. Turkey Hill tastes far better and has a few grams less sugar. Breyers Ive found the quality is inconsistent batch to batch. Other ice creams are smoother and have more taste despite using less sugar than Breyers"
6_breyers,makeupsbymarie,2018-11-19,3,,0,0,I’ve bought Breyers a few times and I’ll continue to buy this brand. This flavor was ok for the most part. The chocolate doesn’t have much flavor to it and the vanilla is very sweet. It’s like when you buy vanilla ice cream and it’s yellow and it just taste a little funny. The strawberry is the best flavor out of the three. The chunks are okay but the ice cream itself is pretty good. I’ll maybe (more likely than not) buy it again.

6_breyers,raidersmonica,2019-03-17,4,,0,0,I love vanilla chocolate and strawberry and they're all together in one ice cream instead of having to buy three different ice cream as I do find it expensive but I think it's very well worth it because they all blend really well I have bought it more than once and I would definitely recommend it to others

When I tried my second pint, I noticed some of the creamy chocolate ice cream had melted down and it had a gummy texture to it. I tried to salvage it by scraping the top layer off to see if it would taste better and eventually it did, but I would hate to repeat this same process on the second pint. I would like to add that it does take a while for it to get soft, so I suggest you sit it out 30 minutes before attempting to eat it. The ring around the container is where the ice cream started."
7_breyers,sdc45,2018-04-24,1,Highly disappointed!,12,2,"I posted a review 2 weeks ago about my first experience about this pint of Creamy Chocolate (whole new meaning to creamy) ice cream. And if you saw my pic, the first pint had a dark ring around the container from where the ice cream started inside with horrible tasting ice crystals on top. Ok now about this pint, as you can see in this pic, the ice cream isn’t stuck to the container with the same horrible looking crystals. I have cheaper ice cream that had better quality than this. I will not attempt to eat this and I hate that I am melting my money down the drain... Somebody please refund me because this is a ridiculous mess, and I would’ve given it NO stars if there was an option to!"
7_breyers,Jenn35,2018-04-07,1,inconsistency,9,0,This is the second pint I've purchased. The first one was great and had wonderful flavor. This second one was dried out with ice crystals and seems to have shrunk considerably in size. Also hard as a rock with some sort of gummy coating surrounding it. Even if I let it sit out and thaw some I'm not sure I want to eat it. This is something that is a splurge for me money wise due to the high cost. I'm very disappointed and I'm not sure I will be taking the risk again.
7_breyers,Caitlin,2017-07-31,5,"Delicious, Dark Cocoa. Simply satisfying.",20,0,"Although plain chocolate ice cream is one of my least favorite ice cream flavors and I felt this pint got boring after a while, it deserves 5 stars for what it is and I think it will definitely appeal to those who do like chocolate! Like the cookies & cream pint, this flavor tastes much closer to real ice cream than Breyer's other Delights flavors (mint/vanilla). No bitter taste or artificial sweetness that I could detect, just pure chocolate. I appreciated the notes of dark cocoa (rather than being only milk chocolate), but it also sort of reminded me of chocolate pudding or fudge pops. Don't get me wrong, they're good and I enjoy them every once in a great while, but I can get a box pretty cheap and they're not high in calories to begin with. I also feel like the texture in this pint was a little gummy compared to the others. I must say, however, I'm very impressed with Breyer's as this pint was filled to the rim and perhaps even a little past that!
As far as Breyer's Delights go, my personal ranking is: Cookies & Cream, Vanilla, Mint, then Chocolate, but I regularly eat a lot of the competitor's lower calorie protein ice cream pints. I feel the more popular ranking for those not used to erythritol will be: Cookies & Cream, Chocolate, Vanilla, then Mint, since the first two are closer to real ice cream and the last two have more of an artificial sweetness prevalent. I would love to see Breyer's take this chocolate base and do something more interesting with it, like peanut butter or brownie batter swirls! Or add some red food coloring, cheesecake swirls, and chocolate cake pieces for a red velvet flavor!"
7_breyers,Darklatineyes,2018-08-07,2,Like eating a frozen protein shake,11,5,"I was a bit dissapointed right off the bat when I took the lid off. The look thru me off completely, there was a big spacing inside which I dont know if thats normal or if it was old. The texture was a bit grainy looking, and the color was blotchy. Not what I envision when I think of creamy chocolate.
Breyers calling is not protein ice cream thats for sure. I have tried a few protein ice creams and honestly this one is one of the worst tasting ones. It left an after taste which was not appealing at all. Needless to say I only tried a few spoonfuls and the pint ended up in the garbage."
7_breyers,Steve8079,2019-04-09,4,"Like the ice cream, unsure of the calories.",3,3,"Breyers has always been makers of great ice cream products. When I saw that Breyers makes low calorie ice cream I was very happy, ecstatic even. However when I looked at the labeling for Breyers Delights Creamy Chocolate I see 20 grams of protein, 67 grams of carbs and 8 grams of fat per pint. At 4 calories per gram for both carbs and protein and 9 calories per gram of fat the related calorie values are 272, 80 and 72 for a total of 424. The confusion is that the nutrition label on the container also states 270 calories per pint. Am I missing something? Can you help me explain the apparent discrepancy in the total number of calories?"
7_breyers,Chris,2017-09-09,5,Definitely the best low cal ice cream I've tried,30,5,Tastes no different from regular chocolate breyers. I don't know how if the formula is any different but it's super creamy. Beats any of the Arctic zero ice cream in texture and taste. Can be hard to find but it's the best <300 cal per pint I've had yet.
7_breyers,Mar22,2017-07-19,5,Great taste,9,0,"This has an excellent chocolate taste. It can get really hard and difficult to scoop, but very good-tasting. My husband tried the mint chip and liked it as well. I look forward to trying other flavors"
7_breyers,Stephanie,2017-07-20,5,Creamy and chocolately!,7,0,"The best thing about this is that there is no strange aftertaste. The chocolate is so rich and the texture is really creamy. When melted, it looks and tastes like cold brownie. It's so good. Beats Halo Top by miles. I'm glad Breyers came out with this because it's better and more affordable. Make more flavors!!!"
7_breyers,Winter666,2017-09-11,2,Creamy chocolate,28,25,I was super excited to try Breyer's Delights creamy chocolate ice cream the 20g of protein and only 270 calories is a plus. Upon opening it looked anything but creamy and tasty but gave it a try. It tasted chocolaty but I also noticed an unpleasant after taste. I would have really liked to know that it contained erythritol which is a sugar substitute before buying because for me it could cause tummy upset. We usually like and purchase Breyer's natural ice cream but I was quite unsatisfied with this product from Breyer's.
7_breyers,Linda02189,2018-04-23,3,Tastes great but carton under filled,1,0,"I bought Breyers Delights because it has fewer calories than Halotop. When I opened the carton, i was expecting it to be full to the top like the other brand, but it looked only 2/3 full and had freezer burn. What happened? It also was very hard. But when it thawed, it had a good chocolate flavor."
7_breyers,jojo777,2017-09-10,5,Very good,7,0,IMO it is very good. Nice strong chocolate taste but not as creamy as the two other brands with similar nutritional stats. Stronger chocolate taste then the other mentioned brands.
7_breyers,VIBridget,2018-07-10,1,I really wanted to like it!,3,0,"As many of the other reviews noted, when I opened the container it was only approximately 2/3rd full. The ice cream had condensed down into a hard, unattractive texture.
I did taste it. The taste is acceptable...not fabulous, but good enough for reduced calorie ice cream. Upon going back to the store I checked a number of the other containers and all were the same 2/3rds or less when you squeeze on the container. Too bad. Breyers, I really wanted to like this ice cream."
7_breyers,CatM,2018-08-05,4,Loved the taste!,1,0,"Pleasantly surprised that it actually tasted like regular chocolate ice cream! The only thing I was disappointed about was that when I opened the container the ice cream had shrunk away from the sides and did not appear to be a full container (as several people have already mentioned). I tried to stick my spoon it it, but it was very hard. I let it sit out for about 30 minutes, and it softened up pretty well, and even seemed creamy. I love ice cream, but am trying to cut down on calories, so I have tried several brands of light ice cream, and Breyers definitely tastes the best."
7_breyers,RetroWoman2,2017-07-29,5,"OMG! Ice cream, here I come!",3,0,"FIrst of all, I love ice cream, but am on a diet, due to medications and heredity. IF I ever want ice cream I have to pretty much have it a a meal, as it is so caloric. Anyway, I was browsing at my market and stumbled upon ""Breyers Delights."" Let me tell you, I have tried many other so-called light or diet type ice cream type products and could not even try a second time, however, with the Breyers Delights, I WAS DELIGHTED! to say the least. I was VERY, VERY sceptical that it would be any good, but, hey, I have tried all the rest, why not one more. WOW! was I surprised. The chocolate flavor one, was absolutely FANTASTIC! I am thinking about how I can stock up on it since it was on sale. Highly recommend ice cream, for those of us who love Breyers but not calories. Thank you Breyers for an Ice Cream of Delightment!"

So good, that it tastes like a full fat ice cream and it is so smooth and creamy. It's hard to believe it's only 270 calories per pint. I highly recommend it. We have been buying the other high protein brand sold in pints, but we are so impressed, we will be trying more of the Delights flavors. The only downside is that at this time they only have a few flavors and you need to let it sit out to soften before eating. (We left ours out for close to 20 minutes and it was still very hard. It is extra yummy when soft!)"

I've been trying to cut down on sweets lately but had an ice cream craving and Breyers Delights hit the spot. Creamy chocolate was definitely a winner, but I can't wait to try the other flavors vanilla bean, cookies and cream, and mint chocolate chip!! The creamy chocolate was only 270 calories for the whole pint. I may or may not have eaten the whole pint. Ok, I did, but I don't feel bad about it."

I was pleasantly surprised with the Breyers delights Creamy Chocolate ice cream!! If I didn't see the package and this was just given to me in a bowl, I don't think I would know it's a light ice cream! I did put it in a small bowl, mostly because I want to enjoy it a few times (otherwise I would have probably eaten the whole container!!) I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors!"

It honestly tastes exactly like regular ice cream. It’s creamy, smooth and very chocolatly. I could not believe this was light ice cream. It’s so much better than any other light ice cream I’ve had. Not at all icy or lacking flavor. Thank you Breyers for creating this heavenly prouduct! Can’t wait to try all the the other flavors! After a taste of this, I have been converted into a loyal fan!"

Unfortunately I would t try god again."
7_breyers,Not Delighted,2018-04-19,1,Horrible Ice cream,2,0,"We bought 2 pints of this ice cream at Winn Dixie, the first pint was great, soft and delicious. How ever the 2nd pint was as hard as a rock and 3/4 full. This ice cream taste like fudgecicles but a lot more expensive. We took the 2nd pint back and got another pint and it was the same exact way. We will never buy this ice cream again, I will stick to fudgecicles."

7_breyers,virupsa,2017-09-06,3,"""nicer"" cream than ice cream",3,0,"I was really excited to try Breyers Delights Creamy Chocolate because I love ice cream but I'm always looking for healthier alternatives that are delicious but still offer good nutrition.
The good: Breyers Delights Creamy Chocolate has only 270 calories per pint, that's right, per PINT! It also has 20 grams of protein per pint, so you're not just eating empty calories.
The okay: The ice cream had decent texture and taste as regular ice cream. It didn't taste too watery, and the chocolate flavor definitely came out.
The bad: The aftertaste of the ice cream was very off-putting, and the pint, even though I tried it right after I got home from the grocery store (couldn't resist a taste before dinner!) was frozen solid. It was really hard to scoop, and even after I left it out for 20 minutes, I still didn't get a nice round scoop. Breyer's Delight Creamy Chocolate didn't taste as creamy as I would have liked.
The bottom line: Breyer's Delight Creamy Chocolate is certainly a good alternative to regular ice cream, but don't expect it to taste as indulgent as a scoop of your favorite chocolate ice cream. It's great for people looking to make healthy choices, but the after taste and texture might be a bit off putting."
7_breyers,Tarihera17,2017-09-06,4,Hits the spot,2,0,"I don't really know how to describe this stuff... It's a solid snack. It tastes like ice cream, not low-cal ice cream. Not chalky, not icy. It's definitely not as satisfying as some of the fancy full fat stuff, but I wouldn't have thought it was healthy-ish. Will definitely be considering this for future sweet tooth cravings."
7_breyers,Merimel,2017-08-05,5,Creamy Chocolate,3,1,Cant hide the excitement everytime i go to the icecream isle. The breyers delights is the new released icecream and they are in pint so you could try any flavors without having to buy by gallons. I tried the creamy chicolate and it was fantastic. It was so creamy and chocolatey i cant stop from scooping. My family loves it too so will definitely buy more and try the other flavors

The Breyers delights Creamy Chocolate flavor is a chocolate lover's dream. While the ice cream had a slightly different consistency compared to other ice creams, it wasn't noticeable after the initial bite. I was able to enjoy this for dessert without feeling guilty, which is the best feeling! I am excited to try the other flavors soon!"

Both she and I got our ice cream in our carts, I chose Creamy Chocolate and she got Vanilla. I got home and almost finished the whole thing! I called my friend to ask her how hers was and her husband got to it before she did and he finished it all and told her to please get more of that! I will continue to buy this Breyers Delights because it tastes great and the calories are not bad either!"
7_breyers,Linda29,2017-10-06,5,A low calorie chocoholics dream,1,0,"Hands down the best low calorie ice cream...coming from a lifelong chocoholic. If my memory serves me well I've had a passion for anything chocolate since I was about 4 years old, and I particularly fancy chocolate ice cream or any ice cream with some form of chocolate in it. One would not think I am health conscious with a history like that but I work hard to find a healthy balance and weight. I have tried several other light ice creams and they all have an odd funky taste to me. Until I tried Breyers Creamy Chocolate. It's the real deal if you are looking for a full flavored rich chocolate taste with no Oddish taste. The only thing that prevents me from having this in my freezer on a regular basis is the price. It's a minimum of $5 at any store in my neighborhood and unfortunately I have not seen any coupons that are available to help offset the cost. If you're a chocolate fan or an ice cream fan do yourself a favor and try this one."
7_breyers,seegeeme,2017-11-14,5,THE BEST,1,0,"I've tried all the others and this Breyers Cream Chocolate is definitely the best. Just the right chocolate too...... not light, more of a dark chocolate. I ended up eating half the container and had to keep reminding myself that was only 135 calories. I'm going back to Winn Dixie to buy the 3 that are still there."
7_breyers,MomtheBuilder,2017-09-06,5,Wow! Only 270 Calories?!,1,0,"Bryers Delights in Creamy Chocolate is a great tasting ice cream, not overly sweet. It is very creamy and smooth, and I really love that it has 20 g of protein and only 270 calories per PINT! I just might eat the whole thing by myself, and that would totally be okay!!"
7_breyers,Anonymous,2017-08-03,5,Breyer she delights,1,0,"The creamy chocolate is really good, to me it has a silky chocolate taste. It's really smooth and full of chocolate flavor. The color was great, but around the edges it looked a little darker. I really like how it smells. All around I think this was a great ice cream."
7_breyers,jpenske,2018-04-21,3,Probably won't buy again... too pricey.,1,0,"First and foremost, in my area, for some reason, it's only available at a couple of pharmacy chains. Why not at Walmart or Meijer ? This means it's too expensive. The price at the local Rite-Aid is $6.29 for a pint, no matter what the flavor !!! REALLY ??? I almost did not buy it, but I thought what the heck, I'll try it. Here's the result:
1. Flavor is fine, but about average.
2. Like other commenters have stated, it looks like Breyers ""preformed"" the product and then put it in the container. The ice cream doesn't even touch the edges of the container. I was actually able to turn the container over and remove the entire contents out of it. And when you open the lid, it's not very visually appealing.
I won't buy it again... not for the price. I can buy a whole half gallon of chocolate Breyers at Walmart or Meijer for about half the price. Sorry, Breyers, you didn't do this one right. Your distribution in my area is no good. I mean, why do I have to go to a PHARMACY to buy ice cream ? That's ridiculous."
7_breyers,ilikeicecream17,2017-08-24,5,Yum!,1,0,"The Creamy Chocolate was delicious. I actually enjoyed it more than Halo Top.

7_breyers,Rynny,2017-08-28,5,GREAT!!! MAKE MORE FLAVORS! IN LOVE,1,0,So good! I tried the creamy chocolate and it was amazing! I've had halo before which I like but this is up there!

Unfortunately some grocery stores have poor freezing techniques and the pints aren't always filled to the brim but it still is worth it because they taste great. Definitly beats halo tops texture by far.

7_breyers,neav01,2020-05-05,5,,0,0,This ice cream is great! It will not leave you disappointed and tastes just like any regular chocolate ice cream. It is a little bit more expensive for the amount that you get but the lower calories and the increased protein makes up for that price difference
7_breyers,danaj4,2019-10-22,5,,0,0,I love this product. I like the fact that it is lower in calories and there is no sacrifice on flavor. You still get a good rich chocolate flavor. I usually eat a few bites so the calorie count stays low for me while also satisfying my craving for chocolate.

7_breyers,barbiesholygrails,2020-03-01,5,,0,0,This is soooo good and more guilt free than most ice creams it has a good chocolate flavor and not too much I like putting some thin Oreos in it for a snack its my favorite and I definitely recommend this flavor and cookies n cream flavor
7_breyers,rener9,2020-05-01,4,,0,0,Hands down one of my favourite kind of ice cream. If you are a chocolate lover this is a huge win for you. It has a creaminess to the chocolate and taste so good on its own. Feel free to add topping through that only adds to the flavor!
7_breyers,Bobbi,2018-05-28,4,Review of Chocolate Delights Flavor Ice Cream,0,0,I was pleasantly surprised at the great taste. Of coarse it was nothing like the original but for something this low in calories and sugar content per serving it was fantastic! You need to understand that I grew up on this ice cream.
7_breyers,alexl6fc3,2019-04-25,1,,0,0,This ice cream is not good. Absolutely do not recommend. The flavor tastes very very artificial and does not satisfy my ice cream needs at all it does not compare to bluebell by any means. Would rather just not eat ice cream at all.
7_breyers,anothersoprano,2019-04-09,5,,0,0,This is a delicious low calories ice cream. It has an authentic chocolate flavour and the texture is pretty true to regular ice cream. I prefer the chocolate flavour to the vanilla. I think it is the tastiest low cal ice cream
7_breyers,nicolea97,2019-10-22,5,,0,0,I love this ice cream. I prefer chocolate based ice cream over vanilla so this is perfect for me. Its so sweet and creamy. The price is very good too and the little container is a perfect size for when you just want a treat.

8_breyers,SarahE,2018-02-12,1,This sucks,4,2,"I bought this because I have tonsillitis and thought something cold might help the swelling. I brought it home, and had to fight the safety wrap to get in. I’m thinking OMG!! This is going to be awesome because of how hard it was to get to the ice cream. I finally broke the seal and found a 1/2 pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream. What a waste of $5.00 and some change. When something’s is advertised as a pint and you can clearly see room around the product and the container. There is something very wrong there. Also there was a good 3-4 inches below the rim. I’ve never eaten ice cream that was in a container that you could see to the bottom of and it was just opened...
Should went with something different like I got my mom. Thankfully she shared hers!"
8_breyers,MAmo,2018-03-01,3,I think I got a bad batch,4,0,This ice cream is great and I love that I can eat it all. But when I opened the pint it wasn’t even full. Maybe it melted at some point and shrunk? I was sadly disappointed.
8_breyers,NESQueen,2018-01-14,1,"Gritty, container not full",5,0,"My 2nd time trying this ""ice cream"" and 2nd time disappointed. First time the container wasn't full. I sent a message to Breyers on Facebook, but it was ignored. It was on sale this week at my local supermarket, so I tried it again - same problem. When you take off the top, there is at least 1"" of air between where the ice cream is and the top of the lid, plus a large ring around the edge of the container with just air. If you push your fingers in the bottom of the container, it completely dents in by >1"" proving there is just air in the bottom of the carton as well and not ice cream.
Quality issues aside, this batch tasted horrible. It was gritty, hard as a rock, and does not resemble ice cream at all. The other flavors tasted much better and I will never buy the mint again. After fighting to get a spoonful out, it literally feels as though there is sand on your lips and tongue from the grit. Huge disappointment, and a big waste of money for the 2nd time. Will NOT be purchasing again."
8_breyers,Giraffes218,2017-08-28,3,Not the Best,8,1,"I love low calorie options of my favorite snacks, so I was excited to see that Breyers was coming out with a low calorie ice cream line. I tried the Mint Chocolate Chip flavor that was only 310 calories per pint. I typically leave ice cream out on my counter for five minutes or so to let it defrost a bit before serving. After five minutes, my ice cream was still hard as a rock and required quite a bit of work to scoop some out. My initial thought after tasting it was that it was refreshing. There were lots of chocolate chips in it, but I found the mint flavoring to be too overpowering. Disappointing since I had high hopes for this ice cream."
8_breyers,RoseB,2017-08-28,1,not worth the money,17,4,"While I tend to love mint flavor with chocolate, this was way overpowering. But even before I could taste it I had to get it out of the carton, which was a challenge. Like another reviewer noted, it was smaller and pulled away from the carton, plus hard as a rock. I was afraid I was going to break my ice cream scoop. The only way I could get any out was by scraping the top of the ice cream to get any out, while doing this and through my frustration I poked a hole in the carton. This product reminds me of the brand Halo, I had the same problem with it too, their product didn't have any flavor. Sorry Breyer's I won't be purchasing this again."
8_breyers,Mrswrath,2018-07-26,5,Minty goodness,7,1,"I have been searching out low calorie high protein ice cream and had enjoyed Halo Top, until I found this!! Omg is this good!! Like to die for good! It's creamy and smooth and has the texture of a true ice cream, but without the nasty calories and has the added benefit of the protein!!!
If you like mint chip you can not go wrong with this! Nice amount of chips to ice cream ratio. And not little slivers that you can hardly tell are chocolate! This was a pleasant surprise. Yummyyyyyyyy Also the price is not crazy high for what you are getting. If you are looking for a low calorie high protein ice cream you can not go wrong with this!!!"
8_breyers,Caitlin,2017-09-03,4,"Depending On The Person, Results May Vary",48,1,"As someone who regularly consumed competitor's low calorie protein ice cream pints, I was actually impressed with the Breyer's Delights Mint Chip. To me, it tasted just like the mint released by one of the best selling low calorie protein ice cream brands rhyming with Tail-O Hot. Identical, really. That being said, I don't regularly consume mint ice cream so I let my mother try it. She eats mint flavored goodies ALL the time and has always been a fan of Breyer's regular mint chocolate chip ice cream. I thought she was going to love it, but to my surprise she spit it out and rinsed out her mouth saying it had a weird bitter taste she couldn't stand... huh. In the end, I suppose it comes down to the person and their experience with these types of products. If you regularly consume foods sweetened with erythritol, you'll probably love this ice cream and not get enough. If you usually consume the real stuff, you might want to stick with Breyer's Delights cookies & cream pint, which is much closer to actual ice cream. I'd give it five stars since I had nothing to complain about, but left it at four as a warning to those like my mother."
8_breyers,Breezy,2018-04-18,2,Bummer experience,3,0,"Breyers ice cream has long been my favorite brand as it’s what my grandma always had for us growing up. Natural Vanilla and Mint Chocolate Chip are the two varieties I love most.
I was thrilled to see Breyers created a recipe for a reduced fat, high protein treat and even more thrilled that Mint Chip was one of the flavors. My husband picked me up a pint and when I opened it up, I was disappointed to see the container wasn’t even full. I really hope that’s not why the container is only 310 Calories. I decided to give it a try and while I liked the flavor (though clearly different from the original mint flavor I love) the ice cream itself was rock hard! Even after letting it sit out for 10 minuets. I am not impressed and now that I see others have had similar experiences, I’m even more bummed that mine wasn’t just s fluke.
I hope Breyers can find a solution here because this isn’t working. I did submit this complaint to customer.services@unilever.com already so we’ll see what they can offer up."
8_breyers,iloveicecream,2017-08-05,4,Surprisingly delicious,9,1,"Was excited by the green container and thought Breyers had actually tried their hand at green mint chocolate chip, but it was white. Still, for white mint chocolate chip, it was super good. Only problem I had was that, like another reviewer on here, my pint was only like 80% full. There was about a half inch ring of air around the cylinder of ice cream. If I'm going to be paying $5 for a pint instead of $5 for three quarts, I'd like it to be a full pint."

My guess, although I am not sure is that they whip up the ice-cream so the reduction in calories is because it is filled with air and then the air evaporates leaving a hard center. See pic. This is a newly opened container."
8_breyers,Lisamartin7972,2017-08-09,2,I'm all for protein,6,0,"First off, $5 is a bit steep for a pint of ice cream. Packed with protein or not. It was the protein the caught my attention in the first place. I'm not sure if I got a bad pint or not. But the ice cream was a lot smaller than the container. I wondered if I even had a full pint of ice cream. I had a difficult time getting a spoonful. The ice cream was a solid block. I thought maybe it was my freezer temp. But other ice cream in my freezer did not freeze this hard. I got the mint chip flavor. It was definitely flavorful. Cool mint. Semi sweet chips. It was good. I certainly wouldn't call it creamy. It's frozen skim milk with mint flavor and chocolate chips that tastes good. But I don't think it's with $5 a pint."
8_breyers,Mintyyy101,2017-10-03,1,Can’t try it,4,0,I was suprised to open the container and found that it was only 3/4 full. I’ll try It anyways but it was hard as a rock. I guess I will let it it melt or something and maybe eat it later. This just ruined my mood !
8_breyers,Rachel F,2018-07-26,1,Never Again,3,0,"First of all, the fact that it was not even close to an actually full pint is infuriating. Could the VERY large amount of space on the top and in between the ice cream and container wall be the reason it was rock hard even after being out for a half an hour? After all of the negative feelings to start out with I thought I would at least be rewarded with great taste - WRONG. The most prominent taste was milk, the mint was there a bit but milk was really what I tasted. And those chocolate chips? The worst. Aside from feeling like I was biting pebbles the texture was gritty, not at all smooth, and there was no chocolate flavor. The chips were completely tasteless. A total waste of money that I will not bother with again."
8_breyers,YsaJ,2017-09-12,1,Empty space and too minty,2,0,"I'm disappointed with how little ice cream was in the carton- I had over an inch of empty space in the top when I opened it. I'm guessing this was a fluke?
Anyways, I find the texture a bit too icy and the flavor was too minty for me, like an Andes mint or peppermint."
8_breyers,Tammara 09,2018-05-21,1,Hard as a rock,1,0,"I love Breyers ice cream and was excited to see a reduced fat ice cream. I was so confident that I would love this product I purchased 2 flavors Mint chip and the raspberry fudge swirl. Both of them were a real let down. They're hard as a rock ,pulled away from the sides of the container the taste of the raspberry had a waxy flavor (once it finally thawed), and at this point I doubt I will try the mint chip but I am attaching a photo of its appearance."
8_breyers,JC22,2017-08-26,3,Amazing Flavor but it wasnt a full pint,2,0,"1. I give the actual ice cream a 5 star. I have tried Halo Top a few times and I always get a weird flavor that goes with it. I understand why people say the mint is to powerful but I liked it and if it hides any other weird after taste thats fine by me. 2. The reason I gave 3 stars is because I did not get a full pint there was so much empty space I thought it had melted....whats going on Breyers? 3. People are saying it is like ice milk, personally I thought it had a good ice cream texture not the best. But hey its high protein lowfat ice cream its not going to be perfect!"
8_breyers,Fisherman on the Bay,2017-09-24,2,Not Like it used to be,1,0,"I've been buying Breyers Ice Cream for years now and the quality isn't what it has been in the past. It appears that the machinery that puts the chocolate chips in has been re-programmed to NOT put in as many chips as have been there in the past. I thought it might just be a flook but after buying 3 ADDITIONAL containers over the past 2 months, the chocolate content just isn't there and has actually be come LESS than previous. At times when eating the product, I have found a complete shortage of chips in the container to the point its only vanilla(mint flavored) ice cream. I have called and complained twice in the past, but it seems those complaints have fallen on un-caring ears."
8_breyers,Janet B from WV,2017-10-08,2,"Good flavor, poor packing.",2,0,The flavor & texture is good for low-calorie ice cream but my pint was only about 2/3 full. For the price I expect a full pint. Quite disappointing.
8_breyers,Sammiez,2017-07-26,1,Taste good,7,4,Great peppermint taste but the pint was not full. This has a smooth texture as compared to Halo.
8_breyers,Amyc,2018-07-18,4,great compromise between full fat and nothing!,0,0,"I received a coupon to try a pint of Breyers Delights Mint Chip free in exchange for my honest opinion.
It’s pretty good compared to other protein ice creams I’ve tried, and I have already bought it again at full price. It is unappetizing the way it pulls away from the edges of the container in the freezer, but the taste makes up for it in my opinion. It doesn’t taste overly chalky, but is not the same texture as full fat ice cream. If you’re watching what you eat it’s a great alternative that won’t make you feel like you’re missing out."
8_breyers,AudreyRose,2018-06-21,2,"Good taste, but not a full pint",0,0,"Very disappointed when I opened the container to find the ice cream at least an inch below the top and about half an inch from the sides. The taste was still good, and would have gotten a 4/5 stars for taste, but for $5+ tax, I won’t be wasting my money on another “pint.” It’s a shame too because I got the chocolate first and it was filled to the top. I’ve contacted customer service and not that you ever expect to hear anything back, but it would be nice to at least acknowledge when someone sends in a issue with your product’s quality."
8_breyers,JDoc,2018-05-29,1,Very dissapointed.,1,0,"We have tried and enjoy the chocolate variety, that is great. But the mint chocolate chip was only partially filled when opened with gaps, and it tasted odd/poor. Like other reviewers here, something wrong with production process."

8_breyers,Meatball0107,2018-05-16,1,No chips!,1,0,There were maybe 15 chips in the whole pint. The ice cream was the conistency of marshmallow and the container had a large air pocket in it. Would not buy it again. Horrible!

8_breyers,nrkrall,2017-08-05,3,"Good, but not great",1,0,"When I first heard of this new ice cream, I thought I'd give it a try. When I picked it out of the freezer section it felt very light and the pint would give in if pressed. I brought it home and tried it the next night. The ice cream was hard as a rock and had to sit out a little while before I could get a good spoonful. Once I did, I was overwhelmed with the mint flavor, it was so strong that I couldn't eat much at a time. I might consider giving the other flavors a try, but I don't think I would try the mint again."
8_breyers,Layla,2018-06-24,4,Way better than expected,0,0,"Although some other reviewer’s thought the mint flavor was too strong, I personally loved it. I wasn’t as crazy about the mini chocolate chips. I prefer the shaved chocolate you get with Baskin and Robbins ice cream, because the chocolate melts in your mouth so nicely. Even so, it was great to be able to eat a half pint of ice cream for only 155 Calories. Will definitely buy again. Also agree with other reviewer’s that the container did not seem fall. My ice cream also pulled away from the wall of the cardboard container and was not full to the top, but I still really liked the product."
8_breyers,Nikki,2017-08-03,2,Too Minty,3,0,It was incredibly minty. It tasted like they just poured a whole bottle of mint extract into the ice cream. It felt more like I was chewing gum or brushing my teeth than eating ice cream.
8_breyers,BreeC,2018-06-17,4,Delicious,1,0,"Usually low calorie, low fat, better for you ice cream tastes exactly how it sounds. Better for you, but not your taste buds. I was very impressed with the flavor of this ice cream. It was creamy and delicious! Other low calorie, high protein ice creams I have tried have a terrible texture and left a weird aftertaste. Most of them didn’t taste like ice cream so in the end wasn’t a satisfying treat. I’m happy that I have found an ice cream that tastes great, but is still a better option for my health."
8_breyers,Lasaritafit,2017-10-06,1,No no no,3,0,Competitors Mint is way better. I dont think I will try more flavors in Breyers delight. I will stick with the competitor. Yuck.
8_breyers,Resist777,2017-10-02,5,Fantastic,2,0,"Regular Breyers chocolate chip mint ice cream is my favorite ice cream of all time. This low calorie version brings back memories of the real thing. It's not as creamy, which is a to be expected, and there are enough crunchy chocolate chips so you don't feel like you're eating a diet product. Recommended!"

8_breyers,ckbell8585,2017-09-06,2,"Pricey, Aesthetically Bland, but TASTY!",1,0,"If it were a healthy decision, I would eat ice cream for every meal. And, although this dessert has a waistline-pleasing calorie count, I am not sure I would purchase it again. Both my daughter and I did decide it was pretty tasty for a low-calorie ice cream, however it is a little pricey. Also, I am a little disappointed with the lack of that minty green color I appreciate. Instead, this treat's color is very similar to dirty dishwater; making it less appetizing."
8_breyers,JackieL,2017-10-27,3,Good but did not seem fresh.,0,0,This dietetic ice cream tasted much better than I imagined it would. My next trip to the store I bought six pints in more flavors. The first time I bought it the product seemed fresh. The second time I bought it the ice cream seemed to have shrunken inside its container and become very hard. It appeared to have been stored too long. It was covered in ice crystals and there was dried out ice cream around the rim that flaked off. How does ice cream turn into powdery flakes? I think I may buy this again but I hope they solve the shrinking into a hard lump problem.
8_breyers,Magzie,2018-03-16,3,Great taste not really a pint.,0,0,I really enjoyed 5 he ice cream disappointed it wasn't a full pint.
8_breyers,mdbibbs,2017-09-06,5,So satisfying !!!,1,0,This ice cream got the job done. It was late and my sweet tooth hit. I needed something sweet but I felt like it was too late for ice cream because of the calories. I went to the fridge and looked over my selections. Brewers delight Mint Chip was the winner because of the calorie count. I enjoyed the mint taste and the chocolate chips. My only complaint is that the container is not full to the top. I would definitely try this brand and flavor again.
8_breyers,Pmb61,2018-04-29,1,Wouldn't buy it again!,1,0,"Container was sealed with the plastic on top. Commercial shows the cup overflowing. Once container was opened , it looked like a cube of ice cream that was about an inch below the top rim. Also had air gap at bottom the l could feel by just squeezing the container. Say one pint but it was actually about a half pint of ice cream for $5.49!
What a rip off! At least when then went from selling 1/2 gallons they shrunk the package also."
8_breyers,ronnie,2017-08-17,2,Disappointed,2,0,"I regularly eat a competitive high-protein, low-calorie ice cream brand and was interested in comparing Breyer's Delights to it. I first tried the Cookies and Cream flavor, which I felt pretty favorably about. But I had the same problem as others with the mint chip. The pint was not full (it went up to the top, but there were air pockets around the sides, which explains why when I picked the container up in the store it felt soft and not fully frozen. Turns out it was rock-hard frozen, but because the container had air pockets around the ice cream, there was ""give"" where the air was when you squeezed the container). I'm used to this type of ice cream needing to be slightly defrosted or tempered time before eating, but even when softened, this tasted more like ice milk that ice cream. There was no creamy texture (the cookies and cream was much better in that category). The mint flavor was sharper and more bitter than the competition. The chips were OK, not great. Overall, I definitely prefer the competition's mint chip fudge to the Breyer's (it sells for the same price and on sale, I can get it for about $3.12 a pint). I might try the Breyer's again it they worked on improving it."
8_breyers,Krisida,2017-09-06,5,All of the taste and none of the guilt,1,0,Breyers delights Mint Chip ice cream is delicious! I left it out of the freezer for 5min so the sides were a bit melted while the middle remained frozen. The mint gave the ice cream a refreshing flavor while the chocolate gave it a nice crunch. All in all I was able to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings and not feel one bit of guilt for eating the entire pint since there's so few calories!
8_breyers,kyokun,2018-01-27,3,Overpowering,0,0,"Tonight was the first time giving the mint chip a try. Keeping in mind that it does have skim milk and is reduced fat, overall it wasn't bad. The mint flavor is very powerful, so if you don't like a lot of mint then I wouldn't recommend this flavor. There was also not much ice cream when I opened the container and it was as solid as a rock. It had to be placed in the microwave for a few seconds otherwise my spoon would have broke trying to scoop it. There is a slight bitter taste after eating some of ice cream, so be weary of that. I have tried the cookies and cream one which was much more subtle, so that one might be a better replacement.
I don't think I will be purchasing this one again, even though I do love mint, the flavor needs to be cut back."
8_breyers,Lori,2018-01-17,2,Mint Flavor Not So Good,1,0,"I eat mint chip ice cream every week and it has been a favorite of mine my whole life( I’m 49 years old) . I tried the cookies and cream in the delights and loved it but the mint one is just too strong and I can’t spend $5 on a pint that has such a strong mint aftertaste. I was very disappointed and hope the company will correct this. If they do, I will buy it every week."
8_breyers,JeannieN,2018-06-24,5,Breyers is delicious Ice Cream,0,0,"I was very Impressed with Breyers Delights Ice Cream. I haven’t purchased the brand in awhile, and recently did so. I was surprised by how delicious and creamy the ice cream was. Most brand, it can be hard to get the ice cream out of the container. Breyers scooped out easily and cleanly, and tasted so soft and fresh! I’m very impressed with the taste and texture and look forward to making Breyers my regular brand and trying all of the different flavors. I received a coupon from Influenster to sample Breyers Ice Cream for free."
8_breyers,kedg,2018-01-22,1,I should have had lower expectations,1,0,Agree with some of the other comments. Rock solid. Even after sitting out for 10 minutes. Also turned off by the space in the container and icy (freezer burn?) top. I didn't even eat it. I love regular Breyer's ice cream so I thought this would be better than the other low calorie/high protein ice creams. Nope. Five dollars not well spent.
8_breyers,kristen5,2017-10-24,2,Freezer burnt,1,0,"I was excited to try the delights for the first time, I normally get the ""gold top"" but I was pretty disappointed to see that it was freezer burnt. Bought from Winn Dixie, opened immediately after I got hhome. I was expecting better after having paid $5.49. I bought the cookies and cream also, so hopefully that one is better."
8_breyers,Ashleyyy,2019-03-05,5,My favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream!!!,1,0,Usually I eat the Halo ice cream but when I saw Breyers did a lite ice cream that followed my diets guidelines I went in! I’m bummed Publix no longer carries it but they had it on clearance for a while for 1.75 and I probably ate my fair share of it while i could. It’s my absolute favorite healthy ice cream.
8_breyers,Cree1211,2018-06-24,2,Won't try again,1,0,I was not very pleased. The texture was not that great. It was hard as a rock. The flavor was good but a little strong. However I love mint. I received a coupon from Influenster to try this product for free. I don't think I will be buying this in the future. I do love Breyers other products though.

And it's also great to know I'm not getting all those extra calories. Happy now of the flavor was lost in making this ice cream a low calorie food! Great job breyers!

8_breyers,SNS1,2018-05-09,1,Do not buy,1,0,"Container is missing about a fourth of the product once you open it, made me think it was freezer burnt.

8_breyers,Verro152,2017-07-31,4,The mint chip.,0,1,"Well I'm going to be honest flavor wise it's ice cream. Well ice cream with a price tag that is. The good thing about it is the low calorie count because if it's just flavor you are looking for then it is like one of the same.
Now if you are looking for a post workout milkshake well it's beyond fantastic it has 20g of protein putting most post workouts to shame. And with the low calorie count you can stay in shape while satisfying that sweet tooth. So who says you can't have the best of both worlds?"
8_breyers,Tallullahbug1,2017-07-31,5,Bryers delights mint chip,1,0,We loved the new Bryers Mint Chip. Mint chip is our favorite flavor and I was very surprised that it was low calorie. It tasted just as good as the regular Bryers mint chip but without all the guilt. We will definitely be purchasing more.
8_breyers,snelson127767,2017-08-01,4,Packed with Protein,0,1,"I think that this low calorie ice cream is like a mix between the mint Halo brand and the mint Arctic Zone brand. It is not as creamy as Halo but it definitely does not taste like mint sorbet. Depending on how sensitive your taste buds are, you may taste a little protein powder, as I did, but it wasn't enough to turn me away. It is an awesome post workout snack and with 20 grams of protein, it could even be a meal! I was impressed by the Mint Chip flavor and am definitely going to try the others."
8_breyers,Shar,2017-08-15,5,Pretty good !,1,0,I've had the other brand of Low Cal ice cream and thought this was comparable. Plus it was $2 cheaper per pint ! Flavor was perfect for a low calorie ice cream treat. I don't normally love mint chocolate chip but did like this.

I honestly like the Bryers better because it has bigger chips and to me, tasted more like regular ice cream. It fits into my WW program so I can have my sweet for dessert. For those of you who say the ice cream is hard. It is hard because of a lower fat content. Just let it sit out on the counter for about 10 minutes and it will be easy to scoop."

Started with mint chocolate chip because of a spicy meal. I cannot stand the
competitive alternative; it's too minty and very icy. Breyers has strong mint as well; but the chocolate is strong and complementary. Plus, Breyers s is much creamier. Can't wait to try other Breyers flavors."

It tastes freezer burned and has tiny ice crystals, and the 'chips' taste more like cacao nibs than chocolate, but I'd buy this again. I'd recommend it for hard core dieters who want ice cream but don't want to blow their diet. Hard core ice cream lovers are NOT going to be thrilled."

It wasn't too minty, which is something that most ice creams are, it bonded well with the chocolate chips that were in there.
However, there wasn't a lot of chocolate chips, at least in the one I got. Like almost none."

Not only was the Mint Chip crisp and refreshing during these sweltering summer days, but I didn't have to feel guilty about demolishing half a pint in one sitting.
The only issue was that it wasn't available at all retailers in my area; however, the great taste and creamy texture was an incredible treat at the end of my bike ride to procure it.
This isn't the mint chip from your childhood, dark green and packed with chocolate, but it has a sophisticated pure mint flavor that will appeal to adults who are also health conscious when it comes to indulging in a post-dinner treat.
The best part of Breyers Delights Mint Chip was it made the perfect addition to a 30th birthday celebration! Thanks for helping us celebrate in style!"
8_breyers,Mick805,2017-10-19,5,Mint Chocolate Chip is my Favorite!,0,0,"First, I love that this is NOT mint green. The white natural color and flavor is wonderful. You cannot beat this sweet treat with only 310 calories in the entire pint PLUS 20 grams of protein. SCORE! This fits very well as a satisfying treat while not blowing my diet and exercise program. I'm currently down 35lbs, about 5 more lbs to my goal weight. Never dreamed I'd be eating my favorite flavor ice cream while acvomplishing this.
Thanks Breyers! As other reviewers said, it's a little hard, directly out of the freezer. Because it's so low calorie and I'm not sharing with anyone, I just eat it from the container. I like the hardness because you eat slower and savor the flavor. I have about 1/2 the pint, then pop it back in the freezer. If I did get carried away and eat the whole thing, it's not that bad. Regular ice cream is double or triple the calories and without the protein. I'll be buying this again and maybe trying some other flavors too."

I expected dry and somewhat flavorless ice cream considering how low in calories it is. Wow! The mint chip tastes no different, to me, than the original Breyer's mint chip and it's the best mint chip on the market!"
8_breyers,Mrs_huffy,2018-06-26,5,Delicious,0,0,I tried this flavor today and thought it was really good. I like low calorie ice cream as it’s not as filling as regular ice cream. I can’t eat a lot of dairy. I really enjoyed it and can’t wait to try other flavors. I received this product free for testing purposes.

I wish it was creamier, it's a tad on the icy side texture wise, but still really good. Not sure if I'll buy it again just because of the price."

8_breyers,babasmurf,2017-09-10,4,Love this flavor!,0,0,"I was excited to try Breyers Mint Chip delights ice cream after having tried some other flavor of one of the competitors in the low-calorie, high protein ice cream category. Love Breyers, love mint chip, and I couldn't care less whether there is green food coloring added. I guess the mint flavor might have been strong, from reading other reviews; I loved it! The texture of it suited me fine but then I like my ice cream somewhat melted. And my pint had plenty of chocolate chips so that I had chips in every bite. I subtracted one star because like others my pint was less than full; mine was about 1/3 air. I don't consider the price too excessive because it is comparable to the other brand I tried, although like anyone I would love it if you could go cheaper. This will not be a regular part of my diet only because I live on a very tight budget, but it may be an occasional treat especially if offered on sale. Haven't tried the other flavors of Breyers delights but I hope you will expand the line; I would love chocolate with a peanut butter swirl, which so far is only available through Halo Top. I have not tried Arctic Zone brand at all"

8_breyers,Headshrinker,2018-02-27,5,Pleasantly surprised,0,0,"Mint chocolate has been my favorite ice cream flavor since childhood. For several decades I enjoyed the regular Brewers product, as it was consistently of high quality and always available at local supermarkets. However a few years ago I had to stop eating it after making a switch to a low-carbohydrate lifestyle, recognizing the early warning signs of impending obesity-related medical problems and my own inability to control my weight without significant carbohydrate restriction.
Recently I was excited to learn about the high protein, low fat, and low carbohydrate ice creams, dreaming about the prospect of chomping down a whole pint every night. My enthusiasm waned after I realized the carbohydrate count of most of these products for someone like me is good but not great, still requiring significant discipline in maintain reasonable portion size, a skill set which I seem to completely lack. And most of the internet reviews on these ice creams seemed to be from people who either really loved or really hated the product. But I still couldn’t resist trying out my favorite flavor. Breyers’ Delight was the first mint chocolate chip version of the lean ice creams available in my local supermarket, and I just finished eating my first purchase. The flavor and texture of the ice cream were quite good, and there were lots of chocolate chips throughout the matrix. The container was filled to the top. YUMMY AND SATISFYING. !!! VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL BREYERS MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP PRODUCT !!
So either Breyers has tightened up on their quality control problems described in previous reviews, or else I just got lucky with randomly picking out a good pint. Hmmm..... I’ll wager Breyers is making a serious corporate investment in carving out national market share for this product, which means the management won’t tolerate sloppy and inconsistent processing of their lean ice creams. So I am very positive about this product.
My only regret is the carbohydrate count is still a little too high for me to be eating this as regularly as I would wish. However I am grateful for the opportunity to enjoy my favorite ice cream again at intervals. And if I happen to eat the entire pint container (which in fact I just did despite my attempt to limit portion size), I have only spent about 330 calories and less than 50 net carbs. Not bad for an occasional indulgence."
9_breyers,jordana423,2017-09-06,4,"Surprising, in a good way.",11,0,"For a lower calorie ice cream I was pleasantly surprised with both the flavor and texture. It had the right amount of cookies (not too much, and definitely not too little and not too chunky either) and a nice touch of what had to be vanilla.
The texture was MUCH better than other lower calorie ice creams, ALMOST as great as the ""real thing"". It was just icy enough though that I am not certain I will buy it again though, unless I am in the mood for an iced milk type ice cream.
Definitely happy to have had the chance to give this product a try, and was extremely skeptical at first, but was glad Breyers completely surprised me with this great product."
9_breyers,Caitlin,2017-09-03,5,This Will Win Over Any Breyer's Fan!!!,57,6,"I must say, when I found out Breyer's jumped on the healthy ice cream bandwagon I could hardly contain my excitement, as I consume other brand protein ice creams daily!
If you enjoy Breyer's cookies and cream ice cream, you'll easily love this pint without a doubt. Unlike other brand protein ice creams, this one tastes less artificially sweet and more like real ice cream. Personally, I'll admit I miss the artificial sweetness but it was nice having something that tasted like the real thing, and Breyer's was very generous with their mix-ins unlike another big brand. There are a ton of cookie mix-ins, but I didn't really find many cream mix-ins. Still, for a 330 calorie pint of ice cream containing 20 grams of protein I can't hold this against Breyer's, everything else was phenomenal! Not thin and icy, but perfect ice cream texture and rich flavor! I would love to see Breyer's release more flavors soon that distinguish them from competitors (such as a cotton candy, carrot cake, pumpkin pie, eggnog, pecan pie), or at least more indulgent flavors like chocolate peanut butter swirl, cookie dough, and red velvet."
9_breyers,Mrswrath,2018-06-11,5,"Creamy, tastes like ""real ice cream """,9,0,"I have been searching out low calorie high protein ice cream and had enjoyed Halo Top, until I found this!! Omg is this good!! Like to die for good! It's creamy and smooth and has the texture of a true ice cream, but without the nasty calories and has the added benefit of the protein!!!
The cookies and cream has nice ""chunks of cookie"" you are not left wondering where the cookie is. Also the price is not crazy high for what you are getting. If you are looking for a low calorie high protein ice cream you can not go wrong with this!!!"
9_breyers,virupsa,2017-09-07,4,Good Ice Cream Alternative!,3,0,"I had tried the Breyers Delights Creamy Chocolate and while I liked it, I thought it was missing some of that indulgence that traditional ice cream has. I wanted to give it another try so I checked out the Breyers Delights Cookies and Cream version (which is my husband's favorite flavor). We were both big fans! The ratio of cookies to cream was perfect, and the taste of the cookies helped offset some of the aftertaste that I didn't like in the Creamy Chocolate version. The ice cream tasted creamy, and it was a good texture after I microwaved it for 15 seconds. I drizzled some low calorie chocolate sauce on it and had it in a cone, and I didn't feel like I was eating a low calorie treat at all! I will be repurchasing this flavor, for sure!"
9_breyers,Michelle,2019-03-29,5,The BEST low calorie ice cream out there,12,0,"This ice cream is amazing! You can not even tell that it is low-calorie. The vanilla base tastes like normal ice cream, and the cookie pieces are huge. No chemical or overly sweet aftertaste."
9_breyers,NotPronouncedLyle,2018-02-11,2,I don’t even know,1,0,"I found this ice cream and could NOT be happier. I loved it. It’s amazing for flu victims who have sore throats. And for a long time you could not get me to say a negative thing. But it’s happened. I bought this (I live thirty seconds from the store...I timed it) brought it home, put it in my freezer. Well I just unwrapped it and opened it...my face must have been great.
Normally it’s creamy it tastes like real ice cream and has real cookies, rather than some similar brands, which have fake chunks.
This is like cookie water that was frozen. I have tried all of the flavors and loved this one a lot, but I don’t know. It’s awful. I’d have given it zero stars, buuut, my other purchases have been great so I gave it two for normally being great. Highly disappointed. I did not pay five bucks for half a pint of watery cookies. I could make that here for a lot cheaper. That is legit still frozen."

I was weary when trying this because I really disliked the Halo Top Cookies & Cream, but this blew me away. It tastes like real ice cream! The entire time I eat it I feel guilty because I'm expecting it to be so awful for me, but the entire pint is only 330 calories! I'll be buying these as long as they're making them."

Real chunks of oreos, with fewer calories, this is amazing."

Comparing the Breyers with the Halo top cookies and cream I would say Breyers tastes better. It is a little more creamy. Also, if you are watching your cholesterol the entire pint has 30 mg of cholesterol whereas Halo Top has 160 mg. That is quite a difference.

I find that even half a pint is more than plenty for me, leaving me feeling happy with my caloric & protein intake! Would love to see a Reese's or cake batter flavor come out! <3"

I am a ""can't stop myself from eating the whole pint"" type of girl so I am always on the hunt for less calorie ice creams. I was super pumped when I saw this in store because Breyers has always been a family favorite. Definitely purchase this stuff right now if you're an ice cream fanatic. I cant get enough of it!!

the texture wasn't that bad, the flavor was better than I expected, and the cookie bits were fine.
personally I liked that it's not overly sweet...I'm an adult; I don't need desserts to be extremely sweet.
I'd love it if there was peanut butter and/or marshmallow swirls flavors, and no maltitol but maybe xylitol instead, for sensitive stomachs.
will definitely repurchase."

Highly recommend this treat."
9_breyers,Suzi,2017-09-04,2,No flavor,14,12,I expected more from Breyers. This ice cream had very little flavor and was not sweet enough. It had a grainy texture which was improved by putting it in the microwave for a few seconds.

So when I saw this option, I was excited to try it. Bought 2 pints. Boy was I disappointed. The texture was weird and there was no flavor. I thought I would get used to it and gave it the old college try. I’m sorry Breyers but this one is not good."
9_breyers,Laurenwcw,2017-09-01,5,An oreo dream!!,2,0,This is by far the best tasting cookies and cream ice cream that is healthy out there. Big chunks of oreos and cookies make this taste so delicious. Highly recommend.

It costs just as much as the 1.5 quart breyers at rite aid - disappointing. I ate less than a serving with a banana. It was delicious.
This is a really good deal from a taste/calories perspective. 60 grams of this ice cream is 72 calories (1 serving, 92g, is 110). It has erythritol pretty high up on the ingredients list but i didn't realize that there was artificial sweetener in it until i checked the ingredients list on this website."
9_breyers,Suzy,2018-03-04,1,Cookies and Cream,2,2,"I didn't expect it to be exactly like ice cream but the product I received was incredibly disappointing. It was grainy, felt Frost bitten, and had a strange mouth feel. It almost resembled a shaved ice, but not an ice cream. The flavor lacked any intensity and the ""cookies"" part was clearly crumbly cake chunks. So no cookies and no cream. After wasting 6 dollars on this product at Rite Aid I can say I will not risk another experience with this brand."
9_breyers,Teresa,2020-08-27,5,I still can't believe it!,0,0,"I was strolling through the supermarket as one does, casually on Thursday lunch time, when I saw one of these ambrosia tubs. What attracted me was, of course, in my 21st century body conscious mind, was the amount of calories it said those nuggets contained. Decided to try it out, but let me tell you, my expectations were low. I mean, anything low cal or diet associated always leaves that hospital food kind of feeling. I got home and took a spoon to the tub. ON MY LIFE, this stuff is amazing. I had to keep looking at the label to confirm that I was reading the calories right, since, from the taste alone, I kept getting the guilty feeling when one feasts on the most glorious of deserts.
Long story short, came for the calories, stayed for the taste :D"

A hugh percent of the people eating the other ice cream follow a ketogenic diet. Here is what they need in an ice cream: no sugar, low carbs, high fat, and low calories. Protein is great, but not as important as the other needs. It's not what we eat it's what we don't eat."

I had to go to a few different stores and finally found it but they didn't have much in stock so I ended up with cookies and cream. It looked a little icy when I first opened up and didn't look quite creamy as normal ice cream. However, once I started eating it, it was actually pretty good for being low calorie. It didn't leave an aftertaste as many other low calorie foods do. So I will definitely give this a try again if they stock it in more stores that I frequent."
9_breyers,Anonymous,2017-09-06,2,Maybe it's not for me...,1,0,"So I tried the Breyers delights Cookies and Cream ice cream hoping for the best indulgent a person can ever have, but I was faced with a harsh reality, it's a low calories ice cream, you will have to comprise. The tase was ok, but not great. It will make a great milkshake no doubt."

Boy was i surprised and impressed, the chunks were amazing, it was VERY sweet and I could not finish it but was not disappointed as it cured my sweet oreo hankering. Excited to try the rest of them...when they are on sale because the price has not come down like the other high protein alternatives :("
9_breyers,Anonymous,2017-09-06,4,Breyers Delights are Delightful!,0,0,"Breyers Delights Cookies and Creme ice cream is the flavor of choice for my review! This ice cream is good! Creamy and the perfect amount of sweet, it reminded me of a Hersheys Cookie and Creme candy bar. It has a bit of an artificial sweetener flavor but really it's very mild as the sweet cream and crunchy cookies flavor are the bolder ones. Overall this ice cream is a tasty choice for anyone watching their calories. I will definitely be adding it to my diet's cheat days and its barely even cheating!"
9_breyers,jpfree,2018-10-10,1,Not for me,1,0,This was not at all creamy as ice cream should be. It tasted more like a frozen icee with a bunch of fake ingredients. I won't buy this again. How about some more lactose free varieties instead?
9_breyers,Klmcirish76,2017-09-06,2,Over all not impressed,1,0,I thought the cookies and cream had a slight chalky taste to it. I didn't love the flavor over all and it wasn't as healthy as I thought it would be.

9_breyers,1234,2018-04-27,1,Not Good,1,1,"Was so excited to try this ice cream, because the reviews seemed pretty good! However, the cookie pieces taste very artificial, and there are very few of these pieces. The ice-cream also tastes artificial, it does not taste sweet, creamy or like vanilla. Definitely not worth the money to me. Would rather indulge in a small scoop of regular ice cream than eat half of a tub of this."

Not sure if I had a weird freezer issue (other items were frozen) but it never fully refroze after bringing it home and it got a bunch of jagged ice chips in it. That wasnt pleasant. Also the pint seemed only around half full. I liked that it had lots of protein but other than that, nothing special and a couple strange attributes."

I have tried many of them. The really low-cals taste like frozen water. I recently started buying Halo Top, then I heard about Breyer's Delight on Good Morning America. I tried it and FELL IN LOVE. Their vanilla bean has a richer flavor, but your COOKIES AND CREAM is AWESOME!!"

I would say that this is the best ice cream that I have had that is lower calorie. It is super smooth it tastes just like the higher calorie stuff. The only thing that may bother people is it being harder then normally ice cream, but I like it. I applaud Breyers."

I tried the cookies and cream, which was stocked full of big chunks of cookies, and the ice cream itself was very creamy and flavorful. Delicious! I'm hoping they introduce more flavors soon!"

9_breyers,ronnie,2017-08-17,4,Pretty good,0,0,"I regularly eat a competitive high-protein, low-calorie ice cream brand and was interested in comparing Breyer's Delights to it. The Cookies & Cream had a nice creamy texture (unlike the mint chip flavor) and the cookie pieces were fine. Overall, I was satisfied with the pint. The other brand I buy doesn't have a Cookies & Cream flavor, so I might buy this again."

9_breyers,Jessipurple,2018-02-18,1,Not nice,1,1,I have been trying out the different healthy ice cream brands and this cookies and cream was the worst I have tasted thus far.
9_breyers,Romilly,2019-05-05,1,Why call it Cream??,0,0,"When someone buys a low calorie ice cream, they expect the ice cream experience, that just might be a tad bit off, because of the low calorie count. In my life have i never encountered ice cream with such a bland taste, which was not even countered by the means of adding more cookie bits, since the appearance of one such as these is scarce as well. The only thing i can say that is positive about this ice cream, is that the texture is done right, it's exactly what one would expect from low calorie ice cream. But for the life of me i can't possibly imagine someone enjoying this abomination of a creation. I am not joking when i say that this might possibly be the worst experience i have ever had with food, i have eaten some things that were positively disgusting, but atleast these items had flavor. I must stop writing since i can't muster anything more to write about the ice cream, mainly due to the fact that this just doen't have any taste."

10_breyers,zoey,2017-11-25,2,Hard as a Rock!,29,5,"Was excited to try this because I love ice cream and thought the lower calories and added protein would be a nice improvement on ice cream. I was taken aback when I opened the container and it looked like it had just been spit out of a factory machine - still in an exact cylinder and not relaxed into the container. Then, I went to taste it and it was (still is) hard as a rock! It's hard to eat! The flavor seemed fine, but it's a struggle to get a spoonful. Certainly could not be scooped onto a cone. This has potential - perhaps you could fix the issues and turn 2 stars into 5??"
10_breyers,Steph,2017-09-22,5,Did not disappoint! Delicious!,6,0,"I picked this when my grocery store was out of another popular brand of ""light"" ice cream, and I am so glad I did! I am a Breyers convert. This is the best version of lower cal ice cream I've tried- the texture was perfectly creamy, and the vanilla flavor was spot on, super satisfying! There was a slight sweetener aftertaste with the first bite, but such is the price we pay to eat a pint of ice cream for 260 calories. I was very impressed with the quality of this product and look forward to stressing out when I can't find it in stores because it's sold out everywhere in the future."
10_breyers,kt1619,2017-10-20,2,hard and container not full,6,0,"I'm not sure what the problem is as I had a good experience with the cookies and cream flavor, but I bought 4 different pints of vanilla thinking it would be a great treat and awesome base for smoothies. In each container, it was pictured as another reviewer had shown, with the ice cream not actually reaching the sides of the container. And it was hard as A ROCK. I let thaw for 15 minutes and still had difficulty with scooping. I understand that many of these lower calorie ice creams require some time to de-thaw, but when I finally did break a chunk free, the texture was just off. WIsh I had photos to upload, but pints were eventually consumed."
10_breyers,yourmothersir,2017-08-17,1,Weird chalky texture and disapointing flavor,9,1,"I love vanilla, my favorite flavor, and i'm not really picky about vanilla bean. I've had other light ice creams so I don't mind them.. However, I found this one to be really disappointing.... I ordered a couple through a delivery service for my self and a few friends to make root beer floats.... I found this ice cream to be really hard first off.... not creamy.... .the texture was chalky... It just wasn't like ice cream..... It was bad... it's been a few weeks now and it's still sitting in the freezer... it lasted through a heat wave.... Definitely the worst I've ever tried... I'm disappointed I wasted so much money on crummy ice cream."
10_breyers,Caitlin,2017-09-15,4,Unmistakably (Diet) Vanilla Ice Cream,11,0,"Although this ice cream does not taste as close to regular ice cream as Breyer's Delights Cookies & Cream flavor, I am glad and respect Breyer's for using erythritol instead of aspartame or sucralose to sweeten the pint. Personally, I can't stand the taste of most sucralose sweetened ice creams, but erythritol is much sweeter, cleaner, and satisfying in my opinion. I can imagine not as many people will like this flavor compared to others Breyer's released that taste less like diet ice cream, but it's still impressive and very satisfying - especially knowing an entire pint has just 260 calories and contains 20 grams of protein! Love the specks of vanilla bean throughout this. One quick tip: either let the ice cream pint thaw for about 10-20 minutes, or microwave for 10-20 seconds before digging in. It gets DENSE!"
10_breyers,Charles53,2018-03-19,2,Missing a serving,2,0,"Figured I try this product as an alternative to Halo and i like Breyers products. Purchased yesterday and opened it up tonight, much to my surprise it looks as though an entire serving is missing. Maybe this adds to the lower calorie count. Gave the ice cream a try and it was a bit disappointing. Maybe it’ll work out in my protein shakes but I won’t be purchasing again anytime soon."

So I settled on vanilla and cookies and cream. So far, I've only tried the vanilla and to my amazement it was delicious! I left it out to soften a little which in my opinion is the best way to eat ice cream. Today I'll try the cookies and cream and I'm expecting it to be even better than the vanilla. Thanks Breyers for making a natural, low-cal ice cream that tastes delicious. Now if I can just come up with some self-control so I don't eat the whole pint in one sitting!"

Look at the attached picture. You can see what I encountered upon opening it. You can also see my spoon imprint where the product was so hard that I couldn't scoop it. I love Breyer's regular Vanilla Bean and was thrilled to find it in low calorie treat, but this is ridiculous. I'm sticking with Halo Top."

My biggest problem, and this is the second time it’s happened to me, is that the pints are not always full. I’ve bought two pints that have only been filled 2/3-3/4 full, which makes me feel as if I’m not getting my money’s worth, because it is expensive."

Before buying this product I would want to know if it had good flavor and texture. And I wasn't a huge fan of either. I thought it wasn't as soft and creamy as regular ice cream. It had more of an icy texture and flavor. And it felt like they increased the vanilla flavor to overpower the less creaminess. Maybe another flavor would have been better, but this definitely isn't my favorite."
10_breyers,Jaybee10,2017-09-06,2,It was interesting,2,0,"The product was extremely hard to find in my state. I had to go to a couple of different stores in order to get this. I found it in the Wegmans where I live. The size is a standard pint which is great for individual late night snacking. The taste, however, really threw me off a bit. It left an after taste in my mouth that I did not appreciate. You definitely taste the vanilla bean like you normally would which is great, but the after taste was not very pleasant to me. If this was more readily available and the after taste was better, I would have gave it five stars."
10_breyers,cadamsbain,2017-12-04,1,Hard and tasteless - not worth the price,2,0,"Not worth the price. I was excited because I like Breyers products. However, it was impossible to scoop the vanilla bean without letting it soften. It was like eating a brick. Hard and tasteless. I've had Halo top before and it was wayyyyyy better.
Breyers you missed the mark on this one and I would like a refund for the 2 pints I bought for $4.29 each. I wish I had only opened one, but I thought the hardness was just maybe a store handling issue, but nope the 2nd was a brick as well. Thanks"
10_breyers,delightless in NC,2017-09-02,1,worst product ever,4,1,"I purchased a pint of the vanilla delights. On the 20 minute car ride home it melted....no biggie I thought happens all the time. I place it in the freezer. The next day I take said pint out of freezer to get a serving of the ice cream. It's hard as a brick! Okay I leave it out for a little bit.....still hard.
Can't eat the stuff it's either soup or concrete!!!!!!
Worst waste if 4.49!!!!!!!! I could purchase Halo Top for that kind of scratch!
Very, very disappointed."
10_breyers,jessicaricharda017ad,2019-04-11,5,,0,0,"I'm a classic vanilla ice cream kind of gal and I was so happy to review this flavour. Made with real vanilla bean, this is a light yet flavourful dessert that can be appreciated alone or accompanied with a piece of apple pie or brownie. Although it doesn't have the super creamy consistency as a traditional ice cream has and the perception of it lacking taste due to the calorie count, it's a true indulgence that you can enjoy without any guilt! The downfall to this product would be the price. Paying at least double the price of a regular tub for half the quantity will make you think twice about purchasing this product a full price. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
10_breyers,Daniel009,2017-09-06,4,Surprisingly rich,2,1,"Breyers delights Vanilla Bean ice cream is so delightfully creamy and thick that I would not have suspected that this is a low calorie / low fat ice cream were it not for the label. The entire pint, in fact, contains only 260 calories and 7 grams of fat! The presence of real cream and eggs is no doubt the reason for the rich and creamy taste. The ice cream also has a full, bold vanilla flavor attributable to the presence of real vanilla bean. Breyers' delights is also a good source of protein and is relatively low in sodium. There are 20 grams of protein and 160 mg of sodium per PINT! About the only downside is the somewhat overly sweet aftertaste from the use of the natural sugar substitutes, erythritol and stevia. Highly recommended!"
10_breyers,Virgo Queen,2017-10-14,3,Watch the Sugar,4,0,If you take 7 grams of sugar and add 1/2 of sugar alcohols 3 you get 10 grams of sugar. Don't forget the servings. Multiply 10 x 3 servings and you get 30 grams of sugar. A snickers bar has 27 grams of sugar.

Ice cream is the reason I still carry extra 20 pounds of my pregnancy weight. I don't like chocolate, donuts, sweets as much as I like ice cream. But. I don't like american ice cream. I have tried European and fell in love with it. Since that time I could only it European one. Well, until I tried Breyers. It has such a wonderful structure, it's so sweet (not too sweet) and creamy. I found eberything to be just right about it."
10_breyers,debb,2018-09-19,5,Converted me,0,0,I love Beyers natural vanilla ice cream but gave it up as well as other ice cream. This did not disappoint. They must have solved their issues because it was smooth and creamy. Not too sweet and none of the weird fat free texture.
10_breyers,Sara8991,2019-05-21,1,Opened. Then threw it away.,1,0,"The ice cream was in a perfect sphere shape and much smaller than the pint container size. It was also hard as a rock. I wasn’t positive that this was the way it was supposed to look, or if it had melted and leaked out during transit to my grocery store. I sent info to customer service asking if it was supposed to look like this or if there was an issue with it. After reading the reviews, I see this is just how this product looks. It will stay in the trash and I’ll stick to Halo Top."
10_breyers,Alex0576,2017-07-27,2,Good but not Great,4,1,The ice cream is good but not great. Although the classic vanilla flavor is there the taste is powdery and not too strong.
10_breyers,esp158,2017-09-06,1,too good to be true,3,1,"There are a few things about this product that I did not like, but let me tell you why I am at least giving it one star.
I like the fact that Breyer's is thinking about those who are trying to eat healthy. With their pints and the most calories one has is 330 calories this is a way for people to be able to indulge without feeling guilty and satisfy a craving!
I tried the vanilla. When I opened the pint it had a slight smell of alcohol from the vanilla flavor. Which in the smell transfer to an alcohol like after taste.
The other reason I did not like this product was the texture. The texture of this product was gritty like having a small sandy type texture in my mouth as well as crumbly. By crumbly I mean that if you scoop it with an ice cream scoop unlike most it does not do a smooth, full scoop but crumbles instead.
So bottom line I would not recommend this, but instead another brand that offers this type of product and has a better variety of flavors"
10_breyers,JeffG,2018-01-14,1,Half the product was missing,2,0,I was excited to see that Breyers had a low calorie ice cream and I was sure that it would be better than Halo. My container was half empty so I didn't want to try the ice cream. I guess I’ll return the product.

10_breyers,Dinah,2017-10-26,1,Disgusting ingredients...,2,0,Contains Splenda (erythritol) and stevia. No wonder it has a horrid aftertaste. I would rather skip ice cream than put those two ingredients in my body.

-To celebrate any special occasion
-Or to just enjoy some ice cream
Get up now and go and buy some. Not to mention the pint is only 260 guilt free calories!!! And comes in 4 delicious flavors. Your biggest decision is deciding on which flavor to being home, but any choice is a winner since they are all amazing."

Vanilla Bean is my favorite flavor but I didn't feel like this ice cream was creamy. I was very stiff. It is wonderful that the whole pint only has 260 calories but it's not a product I would purchase again. It is also pricey for a pint of ice cream.

I think because of the quality and all the flavours that the price isnt bad because now and again the price can be dropped. I shop for it at my local supermarket or any shop that I can find it. Usually I find it in Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and any other supermarkets or frozen food shops. I love all the ben & Jerry's ice cream but this flavour deffinetly has to be my favourite one."

I can eat the whole thing without feeling guilty and the vanilla flavour is refreshing and not sickly like other full fat ice creams. I understand that people may not like that it is not as creamy as regular ice cream, but its not possible to create the creamy texture without putting a load of fillers. I think its the perfect balance of great taste and low calorie and I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends!"

However this vanilla bean delight ice cream from Breyers was amazing! No artificial taste, it was just like you made your own ice cream.

I received this ice cream for free to test and review!"

I was a little nervous to try it at first because of it being only 260 calories and my thinking was it would not have that much flavor. To my SURPRISE it was absolutely AMAZING! Had a ton of flavor, extremely creamy and had just the right amount of vanilla! To say the least I will highly recommend this product to everyone I know!"
10_breyers,Shane,2017-07-26,5,Awesome taste,2,2,I tried the vanilla bean and was blown away. I would never think this was a low calorie ice cream. Can't wait to get more.
10_breyers,staceydemo,2018-09-06,2,,0,0,"Don't be fooled; it is not ice cream. If you are looking for a creamy snow cone, then tadaa! I was really hoping this would be something to move toward from frozen yogurt, due to the sugar still in yogurts, but alas, not worth the few calories it is and certainly not the price point. HOWEVER this does get two stars, as opposed to the one that I will give Halo Top, as I found this to be ever-so-slightly better."
10_breyers,Lgonza85,2018-07-03,4,Pretty good!,0,0,I received a coupon for a free Breyer's product from Influenster so I decided to give the Breyer's Delights a try. With vanilla bean always being one of my favorites I easily chose it. Overall it was pretty decent for a low calorie ice cream. I felt like it was pretty hard and didn't soften very easily but the taste was pretty good. I would definately try other flavors but maybe not go for vanilla bean again.
10_breyers,Anovak89,2017-09-06,5,Vanilla Bean Dream!,1,1,Breyers delights Vanilla Bean was amazing. It had a good natural vanilla taste and didn't taste cheap. It was very creamy and didn't taste like frozen skim milk. My husband didn't even realize it was diet ice cream!
10_breyers,Allie,2018-07-03,5,Tastes real!,0,0,"This was super enjoyable, and the flavor was real and bold, which I enjoyed much more than other brands without the clean pure vanilla flavor. I did find the ice cream to be much thicker and harder to scoop out than some other brands, but I just let it sit out for about 5 minutes and then it was easier! I did receive this for free to test out, overall I would likely buy it again."

It taste better .The flavors really come throughwith the vanilla bean only has 260 calories per pint of vanilla bean. This ice cream satisfies that sweet tooth that I always have late at night and at 20 grams of protein per pint it fills you up and get you right.
10_breyers,Robin 19,2019-04-26,3,Love the flavor,0,0,I love the flavor but the packaging is not right When you open up the ice cream the pint is not full. It is empty on all sides. It is also very hard I have to put it in the microwave to defrost it. I can usually get three servings out of a plane but now I’m getting two servings. If you can figure out the packaging and the consistency I will give it five stars
10_breyers,lindac6024,2019-05-17,5,,0,0,Im a plain Jane when it comes to ice cream but my all time favorite is Breyers Vanilla Bean! Its distinctive vanilla ice cream with tiny specks of real vanilla bean. The reasons I like Breyers the most is its not thick or filled with additives that make it that way it Mets in your mouth and tastes like Vanilla milk. Cant say enough about this delicious ice cream
10_breyers,beckym13,2019-05-28,5,,0,0,"Honestly I'm not a huge fan of icecream.. but once in a while I do get a craving for some. When I do, which is rare.. I opt for this!! I like it plain or smothered in hot fudge. (Smothered in hot fudge is preferred) this is affordable and packed with the right amount of flavor. Highly recommend for that craving for icecream that you just cant shake."

10_breyers,Meuh,2019-05-24,3,Just ok - hate the Stevia Taste,0,0,Using Erythritol was a great idea but Stevia was a big mistake. It creates a bitter after taste which lingers and destroys the potential vanilla flavor (which is not strong enough). First bite I could recognize that Stevia taste. Probably fine with added syrup - but defying the low cal/carb purpose. Will probably not buy again.

11_breyers,Anonymous,2019-06-01,2,Better with Friends,6,1,"I have always had an up and down relationship with Breyers ice cream, in the past the ice cream has ice chucks in it which always turns me off. I tried the French Vanilla ice cream, it is so much creamery then the ice cream i have had from them in the past, but it still has the off putting ice chucks. I found that you cannot eat this ice cream alone, it has to be paired with something to give it a little help it needs. I preferred using it to make Coke Floats or turning it into ice cream cake. Giving it another ingredient sharpens the Vanilla flavor and hides the cheap processed feel of the ice cream."
11_breyers,julesbzz,2017-07-26,5,Vanilla dream,4,0,The Breyers ice cream was easy to find in the frozen section of the grocery store. Even though the carton seems smaller than other half gallons it has the same amount - I checked! It's just me and my daughters at home and we love ice cream so this was perfect. I decided to just have the ice cream without any toppings so we could really get the flavor and we certainly did. This seemed much creamier than other brands we tried which made it feel really indulgent. I could see us using toppings another time or alongside an apple crisp. We will definitely get this again.
11_breyers,Jennwin,2017-07-17,3,Bryer's French Vanilla ice cream,7,2,"This ice cream package says ""indulgently rich & silky smooth"". It isn't really either of those things. It's trying to be a premium ice cream, and while it doesn't fail miserably, it does fall short if the mark. It looks inviting, with lots of flecks of vanilla, but as soon as I scooped some up I realized it was not what it is pretending to be. The texture was way too light and fluffy to be a premium ice cream. A premium ice cream should be a more dense texture, this was almost marshmallow-y it was so light. The flavor wasn't bad, no artificial vanilla flavor, but it didn't really have a lot of flavor, it was kind of bland. If you're using this as a base for something like an ice cream cake or, mixing things into it, this could be a good choice, but for straight eating, next time I'll pass."

This icecream just keeps getting better."

I make them in the winter months and it slightly warms up the ice cream, which tastes just delicious. Natural & simple ingredients are also a plus, since we do not eat processed foods in our home."
11_breyers,JimBobHeller,2020-09-10,2,Bland and Sad,0,0,"I usually don’t buy Breyers anymore, as the brand has been driven into the ground. Yet, I figured Breyer’s could at least still do a good vanilla. Boy was I wrong.
The ice cream tastes like frozen milk. It doesn’t taste like vanilla at all. It’s so bland and without personality that it really should not exist at all.
The only way this ice cream can be tolerated is hidden under a lot of other toppings and chocolate sauce.
I feel like Europeans would never eat this awful ice cream filled with less than natural ingredients, but they are more than happy to sell it to us dumb Americans.
Some of the worst vanilla ice cream I’ve ever tasted. I grew up on Breyers vanilla ice cream. Now it’s bottom of the barrel."

Breyers does it well, with a nice creamy, smooth taste that really feels luxurious and indulgent.

I'm excited to try this with waffles for a super delicious brunch treat. Yum yum!"

This Breyers Vanilla was much better than I anticipated. It is rich and creamy and you can taste the vanilla, not just the sugar sweeteners like some other vanilla ice creams we've tried.

It hasn't converted me from my other preferred flavors, but I really do appreciate their desire to make a mouth-watering vanilla."

I came home from the market with the ice cream and even before my husband and son tried it they were excited because of the Breyers name. It was the perfect day to have a nice bowl of ice cream because the temperatures were sky high that day. After dinner we all went outside to escape the warmth of our house and sat happily on our deck with our bowls of Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream. The moment we dug into the bowls the only sounds that were heard were ""mmmmm"" ""soooo good"" and ""more please"". My son who considers himself a pro at finding the best vanilla ice creams has now deemed Breyers Natural Vanilla his favorite! My husband and I both loved it as well, and I am usually a person who chooses other flavors over Vanilla because they have always seemed to not have tons of flavor. I can say Breyers Natural Vanilla has changed my mind on that for sure. We had a great night keeping cool after dinner with a new favorite ice cream and even though the container is not empty yet my son has already written Breyers Natural Vanilla on the shopping list! Definite a big delicious hit!"

When I first started buying it, the net carbs was 4. Easy to incorporate into my macros. Not sure why they opted to mess with the recipe on this, but the net carbs has gone up to 7, but the flavor and texture haven't changed. And the packaging is a little misleading. Where it used to say net carbs, they now say how many sugars instead. For people actually doing low Carb (<30 a day), this isn't feasible to incorporate. Please go back to the old recipe!!! It was equally amazing as the product now, and I could actually eat it regularly."
12_breyers,MMF1980,2019-03-13,2,Not as Carb Smart as it used to be!,42,0,"I totally agree with all those who are disappointed in the change to CarbSmart. I have been buying it for a couple years because I am following Atkins & had not need to look at the nutrition label...I knew it was 4 net carbs.
I began loading information on the Atkins site for my food and that is when I looked at the label again & was shocked to see it was almost double the carbs! I will have to change or not eat it at all...I can't work it in anymore.
I am not sure why you changed...probably cost as everyone wants to go easy/cheap anymore. Don't get me wrong, the taste is amazing...just can't follow for low-carb diet.
Please, re-think your recipe...I will miss you!"
12_breyers,charlie,2017-09-25,5,No reason to buy any other ice cream,28,6,"I can create any number of flavors using this ice cream as a base. I put about 25% of the carton contents into a bowl that's been in the freezer (a la Cold Stone). I add a tiny bit of liqueur (creme de cacao or amaretto for instance) for texture. For a very tasty chocolate ice cream I add low- or no-sugar cocoa powder and a bit of malt powder. With a large spoon I ""knead"" the ice cream about 5 minutes, until the texture is silky-smooth. Or I can make a chocolate chip flavor by adding one or two squares of 70% chocolate bar that I've crushed with a meat tenderizer. I've made chocolate mint and a host of other flavors. Add-in possibilities are numerous; I like toasted coconut flakes or toasted almond slivers."
12_breyers,Rhea98,2018-09-02,1,Changed Formula! Boooooooooo!,67,3,"This was THE longed-for treat when I tighten up on carbs. I actually really liked the taste and texture. It HAD 4 grams of fiber, 4 grams of sugar, and 6 g of sugar alcohol blended up in a 120 calorie per serving portion. Now it has 90 calories (something a lot of carb watchers don't care too much about), 0 grams of fiber, 3 grams of sugar, 5 grams of sugar alcohol per serving. Net carbs WERE 4 g per serving and NOW are 7 g per serving. The main difference appears to be the substitution of the ubiquitous (meaning probably cheaper) corn-sourced, high GI maltodextrin for the high fiber polydextrose. The fat count has also dropped from 6 g to 5 g. While some may prefer the corn over the synthetic fiber, only carb watchers with digestive sensitivities to poly-D might prefer this version.

I would suggest that you look at all of the positive criticism about this product and take action. You are losing customers because of the changes you have made to the original CarbSmart recipe. If this is due to cost savings, I'm sure people would be more than happy to pay a little more for a better product. Also, why is water an ingredient in this product? That is totally absurd for ice cream. Why can't you just keep it simple, similarly to you Natural Vanilla product with very few ingredients?"

I'm now wondering if the produce is ""new and improved"" or if the company is placing actual nutritional numbers on label.

I asked my husband to taste it and he could instantly. It was bad enough I went to Google and typed in Breyers Carbsmart chemical taste and found these other reviews. I'm guessing the recipe change has caused the taste to be terrible. I won't be repurchasing if this is what its going to taste like. You had a good thing going before."

I don't itch!,0,0,"I love ice cream — I can easily eat 32 to 48 oz in a sitting if I don't control myself — I'm pre-diabetic so I have to watch my carb and sugar intake — when I eat a pint (16 oz) of regular ice cream I begin to itch terribly — this is how my body reacts when I've ingested too much sugar — the itching is maddening and lasts for 8 to 12 hours — with CarbSmart Vanilla that doesn't happen to me because of the reduced sugar — at last I can finally enjoy tasty, satisfying ice cream in quantity vs a few spoonfuls"
12_breyers,ashesp,2020-04-12,4,,0,0,So this is my go to low carb ice cream because it easily pairs with a few sugar free cookies and I'm good to go with some water. Its smooth and scoops easily. Its is extremely affordable which i found suprising with the keto fascination going on.
12_breyers,Sadgirl66,2019-02-22,1,Why did you change?,1,0,Our family has used your products for years but now that you upped the carbs and added maltitol we can no longer use it. We are really sad you changed and won't be buying your products anymore.
12_breyers,happykotter,2020-02-04,4,,0,0,This lets me have ice cream when Im avoiding sugars! The only drawback? Eat too much and stomach pain is REAL. Otherwise a little self control makes this a great product
12_breyers,natashad80,2020-01-22,4,,0,0,This is a pretty decent ice cream if your watching carbs and sugar. It seems to be getting harder to find in our local grocery stores though!
12_breyers,Dobrodewed,2018-05-28,4,Sweetness,1,0,"I tried the carb smart vanilla, I thought it had a sweet taste, I would remove 1 more sugar from it, making it less carbs and not so sweet"
12_breyers,Kathieann,2020-07-02,5,Best ice cream,0,0,Best ice cream I only but the carbsmart. Love the vanilla and thankfully is available and often on sale at 3 stores. Tried the chocolate and it's great also unfortunately its only available at one store and they charge almost double the price of the vanilla. The peanut butter looks great but I doubt any of the stores will start carrying it. I've tried to get stores to carry more flavors and order more it's out of stock almost immediately there's usually only a few available
12_breyers,moni10,2020-01-10,4,,0,0,My kids love this vanilla ice cream. They like to make ice cream sundaes with it. It doesnt get freezer burnt like other ice creams.
12_breyers,erinw46,2019-10-28,4,,0,0,Best low carb there is. Peanut BUTTER is the bomb. Unfortunately I can only find that flavor in one store
12_breyers,bookgeek,2020-02-28,5,,0,0,I love ice cream. Being on a low carb diet it has been very difficult to stay away for ice cream. Then one day my friend showed me this and I was so excited to try it. It had been so long since I got to have any ice cream. The first time I brought it home I ate way too much it was so good. Its very much a vanilla bean type ice cream rather than a strong vanilla flavor ice cream like blue bell. I love it. But the carb smart peanut butter flavor is the best.
12_breyers,airis,2020-06-21,5,,0,0,"I knew I loved Vanilla Ice Cream but this brand had a title that said Natural Vanilla. I didn't understand but I still tried it out. I was shocked completely the ice cream was so good. I know it isn't good for me to eat too much sweets, because I feel awful afterward. That ice cream made me want to eat half the carton, I had to resist seriously. I already knew that Breyers ice cream is so good but after tasting this flavor, it's now my new favorite ice cream."
12_breyers,Grannie,2018-09-02,5,Great for Diabetics,2,2,"I am a diabetic and love ice cream and this is wonderful, it really pleases my sweet tooth without out making my diabetics worse but better because most of us have a sweet tooth. Thanks so much."
12_breyers,wifeoftheparty,2019-08-20,5,,0,0,"Im SO excited about this icecream you guys. I'm on a keto/low carb diet so I'm very very limited when it comes to dessert options. When I found this icecream I thought it was too good to be true. I was nervous to taste it but honestly it tastes AMAZING, you'd never know it was ""healthy"". I 100% reccomended this if your on a low carb diet and in need of dessert options. You will not be disappointed. #keto #lowcarb Breyers CarbSmart Vanilla"
12_breyers,wildxfox,2020-06-10,5,,0,0,"Trying to survive a low carb diet can be a bit painful when cravings kick in....however, this ice cream takes care of ANY cravings for ice cream you may have! The taste is amazing and you wont feel guilty afterwards since its completely low carb! They also offer this Carbsmart ice cream in a chocolate flavor as well, which is even more delicious! Add some low carb whipped cream on top and you have one happy girl"
12_breyers,member05c731,2019-12-07,5,,0,0,"My mom and I prefer the carb smart Breyers ice cream compared to any other type of ice cream out there. It has a great flavor it is smooth and creamy. It is also a great price for a carb friendly food. We all know that many healthier versions of our favorites are often higher in price and briars keeps their price regular for this ice cream. You can also use this in milkshakes, smoothies and topping pies."
12_breyers,Carb Nut,2020-06-10,5,IT Does have LOW CARBS,0,0,"The new listings on the Ice Cream Carton say 90 CAL 7 gr of Car (used to be 4) but you can subtract the 5 gr of Sugar Alcohol from the total carbs and you are left with 2 CARBS
That is a definite Win Win for me. If you are on a Keto type diet you will know what I am talking about so Thank you Breyers for making this ice Cream so people like me can have
ice cream again. It WORKS FOR ME!!"
12_breyers,Blue,2020-03-01,3,No vanilla listed in ingredients!,0,0,"I enjoy this ice cream because it is creamy and low carb. However, there is no actual vanilla or imitation vanilla on the ingredients list. What ever flavor is used is hidden under “natural flavors”. It is very misleading because vanilla is clearly listed on the container for marketing purposes. The little black flecks are clearly not vanilla bean but is the carob powder. False advertising!"
12_breyers,Nanalintx080993,2019-10-28,2,Please go back.,0,0,"I have used this carb smart ice cream since it first appeared in stores, but now I have to pass it up. The carb count is too high for a low carb or Keto lifestyle. This is a disappointment since I recommended this to everyone. It was the only “diet” ice cream that did not use skim milk. It tasted like a premium ice cream. Please bring back the old recipe, until then, I will miss you."
12_breyers,ChangeItBack,2019-03-27,1,I can't buy this anymore!! Net carbs are too high!,0,0,"The old formula fit into my Keto diet and it was delicious. The new net carbs are too high, so I can no longer purchase this product. The taste and texture was delicious enough for my entire family to eat, not only low-carb eaters. Also, the package previously displayed net carbs, NOT grams of sugar. This is misleading. Please change back to the old recipe and packaging."

12_breyers,StephanieD,2018-04-15,5,The richest vanilla flavor,0,0,"With the bad habit recently developed of eating directly out of the carton, i’m in big trouble with Breyers carb smart vanilla ice cream. I can’t put the carton away because of the richly loaded vanilla flavor . And I can’t develop a better habit of putting a dip or two in a dish because I tell myself that just a spoonful will satisfy."
12_breyers,mgu42,2019-03-24,2,Increase in the Carbs,0,0,I always looked forward to my 'treat' of ice cream that I could legally have every night.... now I bring it home today and see the carbs have almost doubled. I am giving these 2 ice cream away.... cannot fit that many carbs into my plan. I thought the idea of Carb Smart was to have low carbs....7 net carbs is not low for 1/2 cup..
12_breyers,marians2,2019-05-12,2,,0,0,"I like ice cream a lot, I always have a little in the fridge in case I feel like it. I like this option because it is a bit reduced in calories however I am not very fan of the consistency, it is too soft sometimes I need to eat it fast before it melts completely and sometimes it is a bit annoying"
12_breyers,Low Carb,2019-11-06,1,Not consistent with a low carb way of eating.,0,0,"Low carb does not mean reduced fat. This ""dairy dessert"" is trying to be all things, and is failing. It's icy, with a watery taste. That should not be a surprise, since water is listed as one of the ingredients. No one would make ice cream with water. This new recipe is a big disappointment."
12_breyers,mollyes,2020-01-28,5,,0,0,"i LLOOOVE this ice cream. I enjoy halo top, but it's so expensive for such a small quantity. I've had it in the chocolate and vanilla, but the vanilla is my favorite. It's always sold out at the grocery store. It's creamy and delicious. Definitely a great alternative to full calorie ice cream."
12_breyers,lindalea,2020-03-23,5,,0,0,My parents love getting Breyers anytime we have cake or pie or just for a little treat for their grandchildren. Vanilla is their number one go too! They can use it on most anything because the classic vanilla pairs so nicely. It a flavour that reminds me of home and special times.
12_breyers,scarletibis,2019-05-13,3,,0,0,"If youre eating low carb this is probably the best you can do. Its decent. Its just not really ice cream. I suspect I must be a connoisseur or something, because my husband thinks this is as good as regular ice cream. I do recommend it to anyone who must eat low carb."
12_breyers,flylizfly,2020-03-02,4,,0,0,This is my back up when no sugar added isnt available. It keeps its great taste without the extra carbs so its great to use when you want a sundae or to put on top of ice cream. Its not as affordable as traditional ice cream but because its Breyers its often on sale.
12_breyers,daniellej5726,2020-03-01,5,,0,0,We go through a gallon of ice cream a night in my household and as of recently my husband and I have been on a low carb diet. Having no ice cream at night was hard until we found this one! It doesnt taste any different and definitely cures the ice cream cravings.
12_breyers,jessicaj97,2019-11-29,5,,0,0,I love that that Bryer's Icecream offers a healthier version. This and the strawberry one of theres are the only two I eat. Theres no improvement needed. Its absolutely delicious. It's a great price. It's easy to find at grocery stores and stores like Walmart.
12_breyers,taylorc88,2019-08-17,5,,0,0,Going into trying this product i wasn't going to think that it was going to be good. After trying it i wouldn't even think it was carb smart and just regular ice cream. I thought it wouldn't be very sweet or anything but it had the best amount of sugar in it.
12_breyers,cjr1,2019-04-27,4,,0,0,"Pretty good ice cream quick and easy instead of making your own. It's very delicious no disappointments on my end. I can't see any improvements, I don't think any improvements are needed. Well a little pricey I only buy it if it's on sale or I have a coupon."
12_breyers,antonior5,2020-06-27,5,,0,0,"My absolute favorite though it is often hard to find. I love most vanilla ice creams since vanilla is my favorite flavor, but nothing compares to this vanilla and best of all is that I do not feel guilty eating it. It has a great texture. Such a great treat!"
12_breyers,sarahandjeremysweene,2019-12-26,5,,0,0,For a Carb smart ice cream this is DELICIOUS! Creamy and smooth and full of flavor without all the fat and carbs! I love to make milkshakes with this. A little on the pricey side but so worth it! The chocolate flavor is also amazing. Just love this.

12_breyers,monicalynn3,2020-07-14,3,,0,0,I purchased this to try to be healthier but I wasnt thrilled with the flavor. It left a weird aftertaste in my mouth and I didnt like the texture. My husband seemed to enjoy it and he didnt mind the taste. I probably wont be purchasing again.
12_breyers,lacrosse3mom,2017-12-15,5,Just perfect!,0,0,I love vanilla ice cream and since starting the Atkins diet I needed to have a low carb option and this ice cream was perfect. I loved how rich and creamy it is. Tastes no different from other ice creams. This will be a regular for me.
12_breyers,DHC925,2020-01-10,5,Great taste,0,0,This ice cream has a great taste. Watching one’s carbs can be difficult. Most low carb items are tasteless but this ice cream has a lot of taste and creamy like regular ice cream. I only wish they come in more flavors. Thank you Breyers!

12_breyers,rachelc77,2019-06-30,3,,0,0,"This ice cream is a good alternative for those who are cutting back on carbs, however it is still kind of carby and you have to watch the serving size for sure. Other than that it tastes great and is a good cure for a sweet tooth!"

12_breyers,kimd28,2019-09-30,5,,0,0,I was so excited to find this in the freezer section! I am really trying to be mindful of my carbs while still living and not depriving myself of foods that I enjoy. Breyers never disappoints! I am so happy to have this option!

12_breyers,alissaf4,2020-02-22,5,,0,0,I have always grown up on breyers icecream since i was a little kid. Vanilla chocolate swirl was always my favorite. Vanilla is a great staple also that we would buy to scoop onto our homemade pies and brownies. YUM!
12_breyers,emilylovesyouo,2019-06-28,4,,0,0,"Breyers has the best tasting natural vanilla all while being able to watch carbs at the same time. Whether its on top of peach cobbler or just in a bowl mixed with some Hershey syrup, breyers will always stay on top."

12_breyers,Anonymous,2019-07-28,2,Low carb ice cream that really isn't now.,0,0,"The CarbSmart Vanilla just got a lot dumber. For some unknown reason they decided to increase the carbs from 4g to 7g by adding multidextrose (as well as reducing soluable fiber from 4g to 0g). Why did your marketing research not catch this obvious error in judgement? Most people buy this ice cream for keto dieting or very low carbohydrate dieting, but now, it's out of the qustion for keto entirely (since their carb intake must be below 20g/day to stay in ketosis) and even less desirable for low carbohydrate dieters. As for brining the total calories down, I guess that's fine, but that isn't even a concern with ketogenic diets. Before your food sceintists make stupid changes like this, do a little more market research from who is actually purchasing your product and what is important to them. Keto dieters don't care about calories, care tremendously about carbohydrates, don't care about high fat contents, and certainly don't care about ""all natural ingredients"" (whatever that even means). Why not make a keto dieting version of it too, which was basically what you had before."

We bought the vanilla because our store didn't have chocolate. It was good. It seemed more sweet than usual, but I don't eat much I've cream so maybe it is usually super sweet.
Sadly I still had a reaction to lactose in it.
I do recommend others try this to see if the lactose levels are low enough for them. It is good ice cream and having an ice cream choice that is not $8 a cup is a welcome treat."
13_breyers,Jmrcna,2018-07-19,1,Lactose Free?,17,1,"This is a very confusing situation because I've been purchasing Breyers Ice Cream for over 15 years.
I began feeling small amounts of sensitivity to certain lactose based products so decided to opt to get the "" Vanilla - Lactose Free"" version.
To my surprise, After an hour I began feeling very bloated and nauseous. I was sick for the night. Im not sure why this happened but I now have an aversion to this brand."

I understand this is supposed to be a lighter ice cream, but now it's basically like frozen ice cream foam. The consistency is so loose that it's instantly melting into liquid as you try to scoop it. Good luck trying to scoop it into a cone. Bummed."

13_breyers,notpleased,2017-12-14,1,Was grey and tasted sour,1,0,Picked up a non-expired gallon of this from the store and it was awful. It was grey in color speckled with black bits - looked like cookies n cream ice cream and for a moment I thought maybe the wrong flavor had just been put into the container. But it tasted like vanilla extract overload and sour milk (funny since it's lactose free). It also didn't freeze right and overall was disappointing. Will not purchase again.

I can’t explain it but it is sustaining me and I’m super grateful,for its fresh and wholesome ingredients. I look forward to being able to eat other foods I use to really like but until then, I’m glad to be eating something I don’t worry about putting into my body, especially since it is almost exclusively what I eat, EVERY DAY FOR EVERY MEAL!"

13_breyers,Theo216,2019-03-29,2,Very soft consistency melts Fast,0,0,I like this ice cream it’s a little too sweet for my taste but it’s good the only issue I have with this product is that even after you store it in a cold freezer for a day or so and pull it out and open it up it’s still extremely soft and when you scoop it in your bowl it melts with in a few minutes you can actually enjoy the ice cream it’s like frozen foam.

15_breyers,Username286399371,2020-06-17,1,Discolored ice cream,0,0,I had bought the cookies an cream ice cream but upon opening it appeared to be a totally different thing. The ice cream appears to be discolored even though the container seemed intact and untampered. It does not appear to be a miss branded chocolate version of the cookies and cream but appears to be dyed with black food dye. It looks unappetizing and inedible. I have had the brand before and have never encountered this problem.
15_breyers,amh88,2018-08-06,1,Where’s the oreo?,8,2,So disappointed. I probably got 2 maybe 3 tiny little pieces of oreo. Its more like crumbs not pieces.

If I was only allowed to eat one source of sugar for the rest of my life, I would easily turn down all else for Breyers Oreo Ice Cream. I would like to thank Breyers and Nabisco for teaming together to create such a wonderful product. Forget all the naysayers who claim there aren’t enough Oreos. The Oreo to ice cream ratio is perfect. Keep up the good work. You will have my business for years to come. "

I think because of the quality and all the flavours that the price isnt bad because now and again the price can be dropped. I shop for it at my local supermarket or any shop that I can find it. Usually I find it in Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and any other supermarkets or frozen food shops. I love all the ben & Jerry's ice cream but this flavour deffinetly has to be my favourite one."
15_breyers,Bringbackchocolateoreo,2018-05-16,1,The chocolate was better,3,2,What happened to the chocolate with oreo? That was so much better and I have not been able to find it in stores anymore. The vanilla is boring and unoriginal. Bring back the chocolate with oreos!

15_breyers,DanaDane49,2020-06-09,1,Bland Fake Ice Cream,0,0,This ice cream is not good. The ice cream portion does not have a flavor. I’m expecting it to taste like the cookies and cream flavor with the rich natural vanilla ice cream flavor. The Oreos are good but not enough for me to purchase again. Very disappointed. The ice cream is very processed. Wasted $10 trying to give it s try twice. Want a $10 refund so I can purchase other flavors. The rest will be trashed.

15_breyers,Truth be told,2020-06-02,2,Not the best,0,0,Breyers Oreo Ice Cream has everything except the Oreos! It’s little like eating plain vanilla ice cream with *specks* of the cookie - you literally cannot taste any Oreo. I would have done better buying vanilla ice cream and adding my own Oreo cookies because that’s what I do with this ice cream anyway. Kinda disappointing.
15_breyers,eleanorb9ae0,2019-01-22,5,,0,0,My daughter's favorite. Her favorite ice cream flavor is cookies and cream. What more can she ask for but the best Oreo cookies and Breyers have long stepped up with their ice cream quality? There's no questioned she goes toward this at the ice cream isle during our grocery shopping and no other brands.
15_breyers,lizak2,2019-06-26,2,,0,0,"One of worst grocery store ice cream purchases as of late. The ice cream was good for the first serving or two, then it became very icy and even a bit gooey. The cookies started to lose their texture, so I was left with an ice cream that was permanently half-melted and unappetizing. I won't buy again."

Other than that, it taste good. I don't really have any other complaints about it. I don't think I'd mention it in a conversation though."
15_breyers,myoncee,2019-03-11,4,,0,0,As you all know I really love Oreos and this definitely brought the Oreos and ice cream it has so much inside of it. But the only thing is like since they were the actual Orioles you can actually taste the stillness inside the cookie like you can taste the weird taste
15_breyers,Anonymous,2019-01-16,5,,0,0,LOVE this ice cream. They put the actual cookie in it so you get the Oreo cream in the cookie. This is a guilty pleasure for me.

I was super excited to try this new 2in1 flavor from Breyers. The branding and packaging were very attractive and I was especially drawn in by this particular flavor combination, thinking there would be quite a good amount of both types of cookies. While I really love the overall taste of the
ice cream, I was really bummed to see that most of the ice cream was filled with Oreos and there were barely any Chips Ahoy! cookies. My biggest suggestion is that this flavor truly have equal amounts of both so it feels like ""2in1"". I received this product for free in exchange for my review."
16_breyers,Mobaker,2018-06-15,5,Tastes like Oreo cookies!,2,0,"The Breyers two in one is an awesome idea! I love mixing my icecrems, with a dessert, like a cookie or brownies! So this kindof already did that for me! The ice cream was mostly Oreo cookie, with some chips ahoy chunks in it. It was smooth and the cookies weren't soggy, they were still pretty crunchy, which I loved. I think this was a fun idea and is something I will be repurchasing because it tasted so good! I love Breyers for their simple ingredients and good quality ice cream! Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves cookies and ice cream! I received this product free for testing and reviewing purposes."
16_breyers,1301Fam,2019-06-02,5,Yummy!,1,0,"I bought this for my kids a few weeks ago and they loved it! It was like the best of both worlds in terms of Cookies and Ice Cream. I am going to let them try all the 2in1 Ice Cream flavors just to see which one they prefer best! If you all made a dairyfree Keto friendly version, I would definitely eat some too. Thanks for making the Carbsmart Ice Cream because I am on a Low Carb Lifestyle and your CarbSmart Ice Cream makes life so much more enjoyable and this lifestyle so much more easier, so THANK YOU! Thanks Breyers for making me and my kids smile!! Oh, and look forward to posting future reviews on the other 2in1 flavors!"
16_breyers,NCH01,2019-07-07,5,Life changer!!,6,1,Brought this yesterday because it said new I like trying new food items OMG...LIFE CHANGER!! This is AWESOMENESS!!! Taste really good. Thanks for the change up.
16_breyers,CHouk02,2018-06-03,5,Cookies amid Cookies!,2,0,Got to test this sweet and amazing treat for FREE thanks to Influenster! I have to say it was between this and the Reese’s cup and Reese’s pieces but ultimately the cookies one! This ice cream delicious...soft to dig right into...and full of Oreos and chocolate pieces! Literally I taste both Chips ahoy and Oreo. Great treat for the Summer or anytime...especially if you are a cookie lover like me :)
16_breyers,Babybott330,2018-06-02,5,Great addition to movie night!,2,0,"As Breyer's is a ""dairy dessert"" and not labeled ""ice cream"" I usually find the texture is too filmy for my liking but this new cookie duo is fantastic! I love the two flavors together and managed to get real cookie bits in every bite. Was also a hit with my ten year old daughter!
Thank you @influenster and @breyers for providing this free product for testing! #movienight"
16_breyers,Courtw22,2018-06-07,5,AMAZING,2,0,Creamy ice cream with the Perfect combination Oreo chunks and chocolate chip cookie dough pieces! love that I can have two of my favorite ice cream flavors in one tub now! Great prices and plenty to share! My kids loved it also! *i received this product complimentary from Influenster for product testing and reviews*
16_breyers,Tishe1018,2018-06-03,4,Tasty,2,1,I received this product complimentary through Influenster. I’m a mom of 6 so a trying out a treat was wonderful. My eldest who is a tween likes it but didn’t favorite this particular flavor (she voted for the Reese’s but majority rules) my preschooler loved the fact that he had two cookie flavors even though he was my eldests counterpart in the flavor vote. The four in the middle said that it had the perfect amount of cookies and it was sweet and creamy. They loved it.
16_breyers,sugarfox,2018-06-08,5,Balanced flavor,2,0,This is a perfect blend of two different cookies in one ice cream! At first you taste a little bit more of the Oreo because I feel that the cookie’s texture influences the vanilla ice cream the most but then you definitely get blasts of Chips Ahoy cookies as well. I would purchase this again
16_breyers,Mely4010,2018-06-08,5,Great ice cream,2,0,"I want to let you know that this oreo and chips ahoy 2in1 is so delicious, is creamy, soft, the combination of 2 flavors are amazing. Really good taste, great package, easy to open, the ice cream melts in your mouth like cotton candy."
16_breyers,StaffPick,2019-06-07,1,Taste artificial,2,0,I had hi hopes this would taste like Oreos and chips ahoy :-(. Unfortunately taste like artificial Oreo and where are the chips ahoy. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend & I wish I could get my money back.
16_breyers,Kloy90,2018-06-07,4,Great concept and combination!,1,0,"I got this kind for movie night with mynieces and nephews and it was huge hit! They lived the fact that they were getting two kind of ice cream in one box and the two flavors were a great combo to put together. The vanilla was a good base and the cookie chunks were small which made it easier to eat, especially for kids. The only change I would make is separate the kinds in the container a bit more so it was easier to tell which kind you were eating. On some parts of the container they were almost completely blended so it was hard to tell it was a 2in1. I received this item for free for an honest review"
16_breyers,Justinemomof7,2018-07-17,5,Basics,3,1,We decide to stay with the basics because we love cookies and cream .. we definitely were not disappointed with this leave her chips ahoy part was so yummy and of course our number one cookies and cream. Breyers always has the best ice cream you will not be disappointed with this flavor .
16_breyers,MrsMaxwell29,2018-06-19,5,Amazing Taste!,2,0,"I was surprised at how good this Ice Cream was, i got the Chips Ahoy and Oreos and it was AMAZING! INFLUENSTER sent me a free coupon to try it and I am so thankful! Delicious!"
16_breyers,Nikmomma,2018-06-06,5,Love the cookie chunks!,2,0,Perfect Oreo & Chips ahoy combo. These two cookies make the perfect pair for an ice cream blend. Huge chunks of cookie make for a delicious bite!
16_breyers,Megan78,2018-06-18,5,Best of both world's,2,0,I received a free coupon from influenster to try a breyers product. I picked this because of the cookies! It did not disappoint. Delicious!!!
16_breyers,Kellz,2018-06-19,5,Great taste,2,0,Great flavor taste and consistency a great and fun blend of flavors
16_breyers,fgmajorman,2020-04-07,1,Terrible portions,2,0,"I have purchased this flavor countless times, hoping that the lack of Chips Ahoy was a temporary quality control failure. To my dismay, every single pint of this ice cream I’ve ever seen only has by, volume, about 1/10th of the pint’s worth of Chips Ahoy. It’s a shame as well, die to the fact that there is no standalone Chips Ahoy pint. There is an Oreo one, in fact, and this “2 in 1”, but no Chips Ahoy. Very disappointed, both by the fact that this has happened, and also by the fact that this is only an online review, and will likely never be considered."
16_breyers,Donnah,2018-06-05,4,No need to choose,2,0,"Who says you can't have both? Breyers recently came out with a 2in1 ice cream where you don't have to choose! Breyers has 4 different flavors to choose from, Oreo and Chips Ahoy, Reese and Reese's Pieces, Snickers and MnM's, and Heath and Waffle Cone. I got the Breyers Oreo and Chips Ahoy 2in1 ice cream since me and my boys love the cookies itself. Packaging was good, clearly shows that half of the tub should be Oreo and half should be Chips Ahoy. Opened it at home and it was a disappointment because I couldn't distinguish which is which, I guess it melted and got frozen so it got mixed up together. Went to dig in the ice cream and I was surprised how I saw chunks of Oreo and chips ahoy cookies. I was more excited to try it than the kids were probably because they saw the cookie on table. Had the kids try it first though with the cookie itself and they loved it. I was able to taste both Oreo and Chips Ahoy on the ice cream and I loved it, ice cream was smooth and creamy but didn't eat much though because it was too sweet on my tastebuds. It is a hit with my kids, will definitely buy it again especially this summer in this Last Vegas heat . *Got this free from @influenster

16_breyers,Benny from NH,2018-08-20,5,Oreo 2/1,2,0,"Oreo 2 in 1 with chips ahoy is the greatest cookie ice cream ever made! I am an expert with 41 years of intense study of the craft of enjoying and eating ice cream. If I was on an island with only one choice of food, they would find me curled up in the fetal position with and empty Breyers carton clenched in my hands. Please for all that is Holy and Good in this world please do not take this away from me. I’m straight out begging you, as I now go to the gym just long enough to hammer down some of that delicious goodness.

16_breyers,FickleMama,2018-06-03,5,Yum yum and more yum,1,0,"This ice cream is delicious! Big yummy chunks of cookie! Went beautifully with out first day of summer sleep over!
I got mine through Influenster for free, and I am so grateful! I'll definitely be trying Breyer's other 2 in 1 flavors!!!"
16_breyers,Jessenia1922,2018-06-11,5,Really love it .,1,0,first impressions is wow taste good .. I really enjoy them together . I love cookies and love Oreos .. the taste is amAzing . I enjoy it so much that I actually bought myself another one cuz I know it won’t last forever in my freg ..
16_breyers,Tina97,2019-03-26,2,Very disappointed,1,0,Very disappointed! There was only 1/2”- 3/4” of chips a’hoy swirl! Love their ice cream but I certainly don’t thing this is a 2 in 1.
16_breyers,Samantha97,2019-09-13,5,Lots of cookie pieces!!,1,0,One of my favorites from Breyers! Great combination of Oreo and chips ahoy cookies!
16_breyers,Maggie37,2018-06-06,4,So yummy!,1,0,I absolutely love this ice cream! The chips ahoy part was probably the best ice cream I’ve ever had. The Oreo is by far the best cookies and cream I’ve ever had. There was so many cookie pieces! Not so many cookie piece in the chips ahoy part which was disappointing but maybe that was just he one batch I happened to get. I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it wasn’t 50/50 there was very little chips ahoy ice cream and the Oreo part took up almost 85 percent of the ice cream. I got this product complimentary from influenster for my review.
16_breyers,Sadlynotjoshpeck,2018-04-17,5,Yassees,5,0,Josh peck seemed excited for it therefore I’m excited for it
16_breyers,Missa,2018-06-05,5,No more arguing,1,0,"Half my kids love cookie dough, how my kids love cookies and cream when it comes to ice cream. It’s a fight when you limit the ice cream to one kind in a shopping trip. But not anymore. The Oreo and chips ahoy 2 in 1 is everything my kids wanted and now they can agree! The ice cream it’s self was yummy and creamy, and perfect for an after dinner treat. Everyone loved it and we will live happily ever after with a just right ice cream. Full disclosure, I received an incentive for this product, but we’ve bought it again and will continue to buy it."
16_breyers,Tom732,2019-05-18,3,Make an all Chips Ahoy frozen dairy dessert,13,4,My tub had 7/8ths Oreo & 1/8 Chips Ahoy! .. it was a real shame considering nobody does Chips Ahoy! Ice cream & it was so good compared to the basic cookies & creme done time & time again.
16_breyers,MMKST60,2018-06-05,4,2 for the price of 1,1,1,the two in one Oreo and Chips Ahoy was pretty good. It was a great treat for the kids! I was excited to see Chips Ahoy cookie flavored ice cream. There did seem to be more Oreo and less Chips Ahoy. I would have liked to see a more even blend of the two flavors.
16_breyers,Missycobbler,2018-06-06,5,Taste buds lost in a cookie factory.,1,0,"This is such a great combo for ice cream. I seriously sat and at the whole tub in one sitting (don't judge I'm also 8 months pregnant) but this is one of the best ice creams I've eaten. It was a perfect texture and consistency and didn't over freeze before opening like some ice creams do. The cookies in the ice cream are great sizes and evenly spread throughout the whole tub. 10 out of 10 would recommend and repurchase.
I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes."
16_breyers,Britniii3,2018-06-03,5,So tasty,1,0,"I enjoyed this ice cream. I have been seeing ads for it everywhere and was really excited to try it. the cookie to ice cream ratio was great, I was expecting smaller cookie pieces so I was pleasantly surprised. I didn’t like that there was a lot more Oreo than chips ahoy ice cream. You can find Oreo ice cream everywhere so I was more excited about trying the chips ahoy flavor. Other than that I definitely recommend this ice cream. I received this product free for testing."
16_breyers,djrmail,2018-06-13,5,Sooo Good!,1,0,This was a perfect combo. The ice cream was creamy. The Oreo flavor had large cookie chunks and tasted just as expected. My only complaint is that there wasn't an even distribution of chips ahoy to oreo. There was a lot more of the Oreo flavor than the chips ahoy. Overall the ice cream was delicious and a great flavor combo. I look forward to trying the other flavors. Full disclosure: I received the Oreo & Chips Ahoy 2in1 ice cream for free from Influenster to review.
16_breyers,KristynM710,2018-05-31,4,Genius Flavor Mashup!,1,0,Loved the idea of combining both of my favorite cookies together in a creamy and smooth ice cream treat! Felt like a little kid again eating my favorites but I definitely was wishing I had a little more Chips Ahoy because I felt like my tub was more Oreo but not worth complaining about. My kids all loved the little bit of salty and sweet and asked for seconds. Got this to try for free but my kids will definitely get me to buy it over and over again.
16_breyers,Chosenvessell,2018-06-11,4,Breyers Oreo & Chips Ahoy 2in1,1,0,Breyers now has 2in1 flavors. I tried the oreo and chips ahoy. Both flavors are really good. It seems as if the oreo is the majority flavor. It is mixed all together and I was not a fan of that. I would prefer to have them separated instead of intermingled. I also do not like the fact that it is called frozen dessert and not ice cream. Overall it is a great product. I received this complimentary from Influenster’s voxbox for testing purposes.
16_breyers,MeghanT,2018-07-16,3,"Good idea, misses the mark",1,1,"I was excited about this one but honestly I wish that it was a cookies n creme and chocolate chip cookie dough mix rather than an Oreo and Chips Ahoy mix, specifically, because I didn’t get a lot of the Chips Ahoy cookies and when I got some I wished it was cookie dough instead of already cooked pieces of cookie. I feel like you’d get a more even mix of both if it wasn’t the brand cookie names. It was tasty but I could have bought a whole container of cookies n creme and felt like I got the same experience."
16_breyers,BrittBritt,2018-06-03,4,Tastes delicious!,1,0,"I really love this combination. Not too sweet and it’s soft! I hate when ice cream is hard as a rock when you take it out the freezer. I like to dive right in and with this combo... no need to wait! Unfortunately, my tube barely had the chips ahoy, it was more like 1/4 had the chips ahoy and the rest Oreo. However, that won’t stop me from purchasing in the future but if my next tube is the same result.. not so sure."
16_breyers,Ash2323,2018-04-27,5,Great,2,0,This ice cream tastes great it has a wonderful combination of flavor makes for a great snack at night for everyone in the family to enjoy
16_breyers,LBee,2018-04-07,5,Love it!!,2,0,"Just tried this ice cream. I love real Oreo, but mixed with the chips ahoy brought it to a whole new level. My new favorite splurge item!"
16_breyers,gapeach,2019-02-05,5,LOVEEEE IT !!!!!!!!!!,2,0,BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love chocolate chip cookies and I love oreos now I have the best of both worlds.
16_breyers,nmb74,2018-06-03,3,Not quite what I expected,1,1,"I received this item free for testing and reviewing purposes; all opinions are my own. My daughter and I tried this ice cream last night. She loved it -- ate the whole bowl, which is unusual for her. I found it to be more like overly sweet Oreo ice cream with a few pieces of Chips Ahoy thrown in; I could barely taste them over the sweetness of the ice cream. It wasn't bad, but it could have been so much better. I second the reviews that call for a Chips Ahoy-only ice cream -- everyone does Oreo!"
16_breyers,mndjhrmn,2018-07-24,4,Mix of my 2 faves,1,0,"Cookies and cream was my favorite ice cream flavor as a child and chips ahoy are my favorite cookie, so this seemed like the perfect combination of flavors for me. It did not disappoint, although I would have likes more of the chips ahoy flavor for a better balance, because I think Oreos have a stronger flavor in general. Still delicious though. I received this product for free to test"
16_breyers,HungryPreggers,2019-05-31,3,Sad Pregnant Lady,2,1,I bought this for the first time and there was only the Oreo ice cream and no Chips Ahoy. I’ll definitely try it again as it might have just been the one carton or maybe they melted and mixed and were refrozen but I was very sad. Mainly because I bought it for the chips ahoy and got more oreo than I bargained for. It was a nice price though and always good flavor so I’m not that sad.
16_breyers,Dede,2018-06-08,5,Breyers 2in1 oreo& chips ahoy,1,0,I bought the Breyers Oreo and chips ahoy 2 in 1 ice cream for my kiddos and myself to try. My kids were immediately drawn to it considering it is ice cream with both their favorite cookies! We were all pleasantly surprised with how yummy it actually was! It was like cookies and cream with chunks of choco chip cookies! Very tasty! I received this product free for testing.
16_breyers,Influenster Rater,2018-06-06,5,We loved it!!,1,0,We loved it! It was nice to have another cookie besides Oreo. Both tasted exactly like the actual cookies. Th cookie pieces were bigger so it was better than a cookies and cream type. The ice cream was creamy. I enjoyed the combination used. Will definitely purchase again!! Will try other flavors as well. I received this product for free for testing.
16_breyers,Linder,2018-06-17,4,Good idea,1,0,"This was definitely a good idea. These cookies are 2 favorites in our house but I cant say I'm a huge fan of the combo. The kids didnt seem to mind too much but it sat in my freezer a little longer than most other ice creams. It won't be my go to ice cream but I'd buy it again if the kids asked.
I received this product for free for testing and reviewing."
16_breyers,Bcampbell28,2018-05-31,5,Yummy,1,0,"I received a coupon to redeem one breyers item complimentary for my honest review. I absolutely LOVE ice cream and cookies so I knew I would love the cookies and cream/ chips ahoy. Breyers is a good quality ice cream packed with indulgence. The flavors made me feel like a little kid again. I would definitely recommend this ice cream, it’s a tasty treat."
16_breyers,VivianSalas,2018-06-13,4,Original flavor,1,0,"I had the opportunity to taste this ice cream flavor thanks to Influenster. Half of the ice cream does not disappoint me at all, the taste is really an oreo cookies, the chunks are the perfect size, it is simply addictive, the other half I think it can improve, it tastes like Chips Ahoy but that delicious taste is overshadowed by the taste of Oreo."
16_breyers,Terrajo13,2018-05-26,5,Love it,1,0,We tried this a few days ago because we’re obsessed with cookies! (And anything that has to do with them) lol we received a coupon for this so we gave it it a go! I was really impressed with it! It was too sweet and it was super delicious! The cookies aren’t too chunky so it’s easy to scoop! This was definitely a win for us! I highly recommend it.
16_breyers,krash411,2018-12-01,1,Not actually 2 in 1,3,1,It's a whole tub of oreo ice cream with a sliver of chips ahoy. Very dissatisfied
16_breyers,Mandy007,2018-07-15,4,2-IN-1 Oh What Fun,1,0,This ice cream is a fun concept. The two cookies together make a great pair. I just wish that there was more chips ahoy ice cream mixed in with the Oreo ice cream. My family’s is excited to try the other 2-IN-1 flavors!! This is my 9 year olds new favorite! I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.
16_breyers,BarbieS1987,2018-06-06,5,Cookie Lovers Dream,1,0,"I absolutely fell in love with this flavor combination. Being the cookie lover that I am, this just cant be beat. Oreo and Chips Ahoy makes a wonderful treat any time of the year. It has the added surprise of caramel. I highly recommend this Breyers flavor.
I received this product free for testing from Influenster."
16_breyers,Tanya13,2018-06-08,4,Great Combo,1,0,Tried the oreo and chips ahoy flavor and it hit perfectly on our tastebuds as we love both the cookies. The cookies were well blended in the ice cream. We love breyers ice cream as its all natural. Would love to try the other 2 in 1 flavors too. Received this ice cream for free to try the product and review it.
16_breyers,Brookie418,2018-06-15,5,So Delicious!,1,0,I received this product for free from Influenster. I'm so glad that I chose this flavor. It is absolutely the BEST ice cream I have ever had. I love it so much. The Oreo pieces are so crunchy and add a nice texture element to the vanilla ice cream. It also pairs very nicely with the Chips Ahoy cookie.
16_breyers,Lyn6,2018-06-03,4,Amazing taste!,1,0,I just bought this ice cream to try for the 1st time. At 1st I was hesitant but OMG its amazing!!!! It tastes so good and everyone in my family lived it. I did receive a coupon to test any kind of breyers ice cream for free and I’m so happy I chose this one! I will definitely be buying it again soon!
16_breyers,MrsA,2018-06-05,5,So good!!!!,1,0,"I’m really picky when it comes to desserts, with that said this ice cream is hands down my new favorite! I LOVE the mix of Oreo and Chips Ahoy! It’s the perfect amount of sweetness and oh so good!! I received this product free for testing, but I will continue to buy this again and again!"
16_breyers,staceysutherlin,2018-06-11,5,End the ice cream fight!,1,0,"I have two kids and they NEVER agree on an ice cream flavor. When I saw Breyers two-in-one, I saw the end to a weekly battle. And if that wasn't reason enough to immediately grab a carton....IT'S BREYERS CREAMY DELICIOUS ICE CREAM. High five for this wonderful ice cream combo!!!"
16_breyers,Mrs speer,2018-06-04,4,Good stuff!,1,0,"My family loves cookies and cream ice cream. So when we saw this we were sure it would be a hit. And it was good, but not our favorite. The ice cream is creamy and smooth like I expected, it was just a bit sweet for my tastes. The husband on the other hand absolutely loved it!"
16_breyers,Sam22,2018-09-01,5,Addicting!,1,0,This ice cream is SO good. My fiancé and I ate the entire tub in just two sittings! What a fantastic combination of cookies. We are very excited to try all the other 2 in 1 combinations! Each week we will try a new flavor together! Keep up the great work breyers!

16_breyers,ChristalC,2018-08-02,4,Delicious,1,0,I love Breyers and I love this combination. However the reason for my 4 star rating is that there are mostly Oreo cookie pieces and hardly any Chips Ahoy. Make the amount equal and I would give this 5 stars for sure.
16_breyers,Cm13438,2018-06-17,5,A truly awesome combination,1,0,This duo is the Batman and Robin of ice cream and it has become a new summer favorite in our home . Now we don't have to choose which we like better awesome idea Breyers and it was truly an awesome ice cream .

16_breyers,KeiraKurby,2018-11-26,2,Disappointed Again!,0,1,"This is the second time I have purchased Breyer's 2 in 1 ice cream and I have to say it's disappointing. It is far from being evenly distributed. I received a container with 3/4 Oreo and 1/4 Chips Ahoy! It saddens me because I preferred the Chips Ahoy and that's what I looked forward to the most. Same goes with the Snickers and M&Ms, 3/4 Snickers and 1/4 M&M side and I preferred the M&M. I will not purchase this brand anymore because to fail twice, is not okay in my book."

I was really looking forward to this ice crea,m since it’s really the best of both worlds. after opening and digging in the entire tub was cookies and cream with an inch sliver of the Carmel ice cream.

I was expecting more of a cookie dough like ice cream but this is actual cookie chunks. It just didn’t work for me, my kids However must have loved it because they ate the whole thing in two days! I picked this up because i had a free coupon, i will be trying other flavors for sure."

So Breyer's, please, please, please make this lactose free or nondairy! Cashew milk would be delish!"

16_breyers,YummyIceCream,2019-06-11,3,Taste is good but flavors not balanced,0,0,There is 99% Oreo ice cream and 1% chips ahoy. The taste was delicious however it’s false advertising when it’s all Oreo ice cream. Need to sell chips ahoy as it’s own ice cream flavor. The 2n1 name implies 1/2 and 1/2 of each flavor which is not what you get. Quality of product just isn’t there

17_breyers,arielnina,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"Love vanilla ice cream,especially the french vanilla flavored kind. Good price for quality ice cream. It's really good, my son loves it with chocolate syrup and whip cream but it is good by itself as well. I can also find it at pretty much any store so overall I would say it is worth the cost "

17_breyers,____jazel____,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,Amazing ice cream that’s perfectly made. I love to eat it with a bit of cinnamon sprinkled on it. They just pair so nicely. Also it’s super easy to scoop compared to other ice cream I’ve had. You really can’t go wrong with it. Who doesn’t like caramel??

However, I love to try new things and I had never had gelato. I was not only pleasantly surprised, but also completely blown away by this sweet treat. The texture is smooth and creamy, not overly sweet on its own. It's not ice cold like ice cream, so it's wonderful for sensitive teeth. The caramel has got real caramel flavor, none of that maple syrup flavor at all. The caramel shavings melt in your mouth and it's a shame that I have already finished the top parts of the container and have none left! :) Overall, the Vanilla Caramel Gelato Indulgences was a fabulous treat and I can't wait to buy it again.
I received a coupon from Influenster to try this product for free. All thoughts and opinions are my own."
18_breyers,KateD,2018-06-07,5,Perfect summer treat,1,0,"I branched out from my normal ice cream purchase to try something new. I didn’t have any expectations going into it, but I was pleasantly surprised by what I found! The gelato has a much creamier texture and a richer flavor. I really like the balance between the vanilla gelato and the caramel and chocolate sauce. The crunch on top is my favorite part! I do find, with how rich it is a smaller portion hits the sweet spot much quicker.
I really like that Brewers ingredients make it a no brainer when sharing with my kids. The no nonsense, real ingredients give me confidence in letting my kids indulge along with me.

Then, after I bought another container, a friend was over and I brought the container out- telling her there was something wrong with this gelato stuff. I gave her a spoon. We sat opposite each other taking spoonful after spoonful, savoring each bite but decidedly trying to find out why it was so delicious, different and unstoppable; right up to finishing the container in that sitting, we couldn't find the answer. We have to keep eating this until we figure it out"

It is my most favorite desert item in the freezer aisle so I have to admit that I haven't bother trying any of the other flavors.
The vanilla caramel is almost as good. But as you can see in the picture it's half empty. I was planning on taking a picture of it when it was full but my husband got to it before I could. He definitely places this in his number one spot. We love the lightness and rich flavors. We finished the whole container in one sitting. It was really hard to put the spoon down. Being that I am 9 months pregnant this gelato was an awesome late at night desert fix. I will stocking up."
18_breyers,Mara,2019-06-16,1,Caramel tasted bitter and burnt!,0,3,"We loved Breyers gelato when it first became available, but our store quit carrying it for a long time. We were happy to find Breyers Vanilla Caramel Gelato in the store freezer section yesterday and bought it as a treat for ourselves. We tried the gelato last night and it was horrible! The caramel was so bitter and burnt-tasting that the rest of the package went into the garbage. Judging by the other reviews, we may have gotten a bad batch, but we're seniors on a fixed income and can't afford to waste good money on bad food. It was a real disappointment because all the other Breyers products we've eaten over the years were excellent."
18_breyers,Kandilbar,2018-06-08,5,A little taste of heaven!,0,0,I bought this gelato this past weekend. I believe it only lasted 2 days in my house. The Gelato is so creamy and silky smooth. It's the best gelato I've had. The caramel is so creamy and sweet but not overly sweet. It truly is bites of heaven. I did receive a coupon to try it free for testing purposes. That didn't change my thoughts this is wonderful. I need to get the other flavors.

The only thing I didn't like was that the Breyers Gelato seemed to melt fast. As soon as I took it out of the freezer it began melting as I was scooping it out. However, it did not lose it's flavor once I put it back in the freezer.
I would definitely recommend the Breyers Gelato Vanilla Caramel because it tasted very good and was perfect for a treat."
18_breyers,Auntrose,2017-08-01,5,Excellent and natural tasting,1,0,I couldn't wait to try the new Brewers Gelato and was pleasantly surprised when I did. I went for the vanilla caramel and was eager to see just how different it was compared to the others on the market. It was smooth and rich tasting. Not fake tasting and no aftertaste. Truly such a delight! Soothed my sweet tooth and was very filling! The only thing is I noticed that the packaging was small (as all Breyer products are) compared to the other ice cream and gelato that I usually buy
18_breyers,angdel,2017-07-29,5,Creamy delicious ice cream,1,0,"There are many ice cream products out there, and it is hard to know what to try and what will be good. Don't waste your time and get right to trying Breyers Gelato. It is such a treat and it transforms you like you are somewhere else. I feel like I was eating ice cream at a stand rather than from my freezer. The blend of the caramel with the vanilla is just right and makes it sweet but not too sweet. I would suggest you go to the store and get this right away!"
18_breyers,TKing,2018-06-04,5,CARAMEL Lover's Dream Come True,0,0,I absolutely loved the creaminess of the vanilla gelato and the caramel sauce that ran thru the entire container. The caramel shreds all throughout the top of the gelato are only on the top but they are like caramel crisps. The vanilla gelato is so much creamier and softer than regular vanilla ice cream and the vanilla flavor is stronger. The caramel sauce is decadent and smooth. I really enjoyed this treat and I am excited to try the other flavors. I really felt like I was eating a upscale dessert more than ice cream from my freezer. For sure this will be a new staple when I go to the grocery store. I did receive the product free of charge via Influenster to test and review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.

I thought it was just another name for ice cream but found out it is so much more. The Breyers Gelato Chocolate Caramel is amazing! The texture is way creamier than ice cream and the flavor is so rich and tasty. It is 170 calories (1/2 cup) of sweet goodness that melts in my mouth and bathes my taste buds in a rich chocolate gelato with caramel swirls throughout it. As if that wasn't enough, they put chocolate shavings on top. I won't make the mistake of calling it ice cream again,"

I'm not usually a fan of ice cream, I'll eat it but I don't go out of my way to purchase it. However, the Vanilla Caramel Gelato is simply so darn good that if one grocery store is sold out, I'll go to another until I find it. There are no words to adequately describe this delicious indulgence. Try it, and you will be hooked just like me."

Smooth and more flavorful than ice cream. We have had fruity gelatos many times but never tried a vanilla or caramel one and these together in one are perfect. Breyers is known for their natural ingredients and that carries over into their gelatos for sure. I would highly recommend trying this gelato. It is not overly sweet at all. If you like Breyers ice cream you will LOVE the gelato!!"
18_breyers,seboss12,2017-07-19,5,Best frozen treat,1,0,"Brewers gelato is one of my favorite frozen treats! It is silky smooth and has a great taste. It was super easy to scoop out, even right from the freezer. The flavor I had had thick swirls of caramel that melted in my mouth and perfectly portions chocolate bits on top. The gelato itself had a perfectly balanced flavor that made it a nice treat. A small portion is perfect for an anytime snack."
18_breyers,Jani,2019-07-21,5,"OMG, The Best EVER",0,0,"Breyers Vanilla/Caramel Gelato is the best naughty sin that I indulge in every single night.I have had a dish of ice cream every night before bed since I was 20yrs old, but since I discovered Breyers Gelato, I haven't gone back to regular ice cream. This is sooo creamy and smooth, the caramel is swirled in perfect proportions throughout, and the caramel shavings on top are the best, ever. When I shop at our local Walmart, I purchase ALL they have, and fill my big freezer here at home. I wish they had all the flavors, but they only carry the Vanilla/Caramel. Which is ok, since I am forever addicted to this flavor. Thank you Breyers for making this GREAT product. I own a beauty shop and tell all my customers about this sinfully good product-love it!!!"
18_breyers,feyirie,2017-07-31,5,We love it!,1,0,"This gelato is soooo smooth and creamy! My favorite part about it is the fact that it is not overly sweet... you can really enjoy the flavor, coolness and creaminess of the vanilla. My husband is a caramel fanatic so of course his favorite part is the thick caramel swirls. I'm so happy I had the chance to try this and I will definitely be buying it in the future!"
18_breyers,Anonymous,2017-08-05,5,Sweet and satisfying!,1,0,"I recently tried Breyer's Gelato and I am hooked! The soft, creamy texture and sweet caramel flavor were the perfect combination. This cool treat is so much more satisfying than ice cream. Think light, vanilla gelato with ribbons of caramel in every bite. Mmmmm, the perfect after dinner dessert. I couldn't dream up a better flavor combination."
18_breyers,jeannoh,2017-08-01,3,Breyers should stick with ice cream,0,3,"We've always like Breyer's Ice Cream b/c it has only the few, natural ingredients that ice cream should have. So, when I saw they came out with a gelato line, I decided to try it. It tasted fine - a little lighter than ice cream but still creamy. It just didn't stand out in way, shape or form that I was eating gelato. Hence, my mediocre rating - it's neither here nor there. For the price, I'd probably just go back to their ice cream. My 3 kids and husband all agree."

Thank goodness for this BzzAgent campaign! I tried Breyers Gelato Vanilla Caramel! I sat on my porch in the summer heat and enjoyed every bite! The Gelato was extremely smooth and creamy. Your first bite you get a stream of caramel & shaved chocolate. I can't wait to try the other three flavors! I MIGHT just share with my husband!
18_breyers,soeurwatt,2017-07-29,4,Breyers Gelato Vanilla Caramel,0,1,"Words that came to my mind as I ate this - creamy, smooth, rich. A little goes a long way. I normally like caramel with vanilla ice cream but this caramel was much too strong. It helped to mix it in with the vanilla. The shavings of caramel on top added to the texture but not the flavor, I could do without. The vanilla ice cream was very delicious and dense, what I expect from a gelato. Overall it was an indulgent treat."

Between the two of us it was gone before night time! I went to the store the next day to buy two more for our dinner. (it was appreciated at our dinner, too). I wish it had more natural ingredients (I hate that it has corn syrup and carrageenan, etc) but it's delicious and I'll use it as a special treat."

It is smooth and filled with soft gooey caramel. I love it and will not go back to regular ice cream. In fact I have recommended it TWICE today. Once to a friend and then to the cashier who was checking me out at the store. I would tell everyone to try it.

I liked the large amounts of caramel that ran through it. I took one star away because for me it was a little too sweet but then added it back because my husband and kids thought it was perfect.

The vanilla ""base"" was not creamy or vanilla-y at all, it just tasted like sweet milk. The caramel was a small bright spot, but the shavings on top tasted waxy and fake.
I received this product free for testing and views are my own."
18_breyers,Katie3424,2017-08-03,5,"Creamy, delicious gelato",0,1,This gelato is very creamy and delicious. The vanilla is not overly sweet which is a perfect match for the sweet caramel sauce that is dispersed throughout. There is a good ratio of vanilla to caramel and the caramel crunchies on top add a nice texture. I will definitely purchase this gelato again and will be trying the other flavors as well.
18_breyers,Laurent,2018-06-05,5,Delicious!,0,0,Picked this up for an adult treat that the kids wouldn’t try and dig into. We loved it.

I'm more concerned with the taste and price. The flavor was great and tasted like it was made with quality ingredients. The price is a little high. I'd love to see the toppings throughout the gelato. Overall good.

18_breyers,WendelV,2017-08-05,4,Two Yums Up!!,0,0,"It took me awhile to buy in to the whole gelato craze. When I did try it from time to time, I frankly couldn't really tell the difference between gelato and regular ice cream, and I had heard that ice cream is creamier, which personally I prefer. So I didn't really understand what the big deal was, especially since a lot of gelato brands seemed quite pricey compared to ice cream.
I can honestly say, that the Breyers Vanilla Caramel Gelato has made me reconsider. It is, in a word, delicious. The texture is so creamy, it melts like cream in your mouth. The flavors really come through. The vanilla is genuine - no chemical aftertaste or bitterness. I love anything toffee or caramel flavored. The caramel was buttery and velvety smooth. Combined with the gelato, it was very satisfying. It can be hard not to eat ice cream fast, but I found myself really taking my time and enjoying each bite. And it's not made with a lot of junk and unpronounceable ingredients. If I could make any recommendations, it would be to make the quantity bigger - we went through the container in no time. In addition, I was looking for caramel swirl in every bite, and while there was plenty of caramel, that didn't happen. And the toppings that are added - the chocolate caramels - seemed like they were added as an afterthought. Please either add more or mix them in. I would definitely purchase Breyers gelato again. In fact, we went back a week later to try another flavor. It was also creamy and delicious. It is a bit pricey, but if it's on sale or I have a coupon, I would go for it for sure."
19_breyers,23skiddoo,2017-12-11,1,"Agree w/Others, Where's the Mint?",1,0,"Based on the picture and description, I was expecting two colors of ice cream. Mine it ALL chocolate and absolutely no mint. I even dug down to the bottom to see if by chance it didn't get swirled and the mint was stuck at the bottom. No luck. It looked nothing like the picture. I feel better after seeing I'm not imagining things when I saw others have had the same problem. Not sure what happened, but there appears to be a serious problem with this particular flavor. I will send something to the customer service email listed in the other reviews. The chocolate ice cream is really good, but I wanted chocolate and mint."

I saw the new Chocolate Mint Ice Cream flavor on the shelf and decided to try it.
It's horrid. There's hardly a hint of mint, but the chocolate is as strong and present as regular chocolate icecream. And I see so many choc varieties that6 it6 seems sometimes that chocolate is all there is.
So thanks, but No Thanks. I'll stick with the Mint Chocolate Chip because if it has something that this new flavor doesn't have, it's a mint flavor."
19_breyers,dlawson,2019-11-25,1,Does NOT taste like Peppermint,1,0,"This ice cream taste like regular chocolate ice cream. There is BARELY any peppermint flavor. You can NOT taste it unless you only eat the white mint part of the ice cream, which there is very little of. If you ask me replace the chucks of chocolate with crushed up peppermint and intensify the peppermint flavor/add more of the white mint part to balance out the chocolate. I was looking forward to trying this product but I am absolutely UNIMPRESSED!!!

I was referred to Walmart. I found the Breyers products...and to my chagrin, the""peach"" carton says ""frozen dairy desert,"" but not ICE CREAM! This means that the product does not meet the legal standards required for something to be sold as Ice Cream, and it also means that Breyers has lost another customer. I long for the days when Breyers was made in Philadelphia, and everything was top notch. The Vanilla had REAL Vanilla beans in it. I concur with the other reviews. This does not even BEGIN to be Peach Ice Cream if it can't even BE Ice Cream!!!!!"

Lost a buyer - going back to the only other company I do buy. and by the way this peach stuff is SO SWEET ..leaves a weird taste and not that much peach flavor or chunks or peach witch all that made me stop go read the carton and go what the heck?

It used to be so much thick, now it's like eating whip cream with peaches in it. The sweetened taste is sweetener, you could taste it. Disheartening, this ice cream isn't the same, it's not sold as half a gallon anymore, only as 1.5 Quarts. They lost a customer."
20_breyers,Cedric,2020-09-13,1,Absolutely disgusting.,1,0,I grew up in a small town near a peach and other produce packing house. I can assure you that this isn't real peach ice cream. I'm from Peach County Ga. You couldn't sell a drop of this trash anywhere near there. They dont even attempt to sell it in stores there. I moved out to Seattle and this is the garbage that people call peach ice cream. If you would really like real peach ice cream find a peach packing house. The chunks of orange stuff in it taste nothing like any peach I've ever tasted and I've eaten thousands. It is the worst ice cream I have ever had. I better not try anything new they make. Stick with the basics.

I live in the peach state and know peach ice cream, and I hate to say it but this is the worst peach ice cream I have ever tried. Living in Georgia and being raised around peach orchards I have experienced great tasting peaches. The peaches y’all use in your ice cream need to be given more time to ripen the more they ripen the sweeter the ice cream will turn out. Surprisingly the better the peach flavor will be."

Yes it was smooth but in had a foamy consistency, unlike the original vanilla which has a pure creaminess. The peach taste like the less expensive ice creams. The peaches were plentiful and fresh. Nice. Why did you have to ruin it with corn syrup and less than 2% or less of Vegetable Gums, Guar, Mono and Diglycerides. Granted, things cost more however those ingredients cost as well. Save your money and stick to ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS PLEASE. I have enjoyed Breyers since a child and remember THE GOOD BREYERS. The way to compete and win is to remain Authentic When we know better, we do better. Do Better Breyers like the Good ole Authentic days. Thank you for this forum.."
20_breyers,JR04,2017-12-25,4,Finding Peach Breyers in Southeast Florida,2,2,"Your store locator feature is geared exclusively towards the large Anglo supermarket, department store and pharmacy chains. Entering a southeast Florida zip code leads one to believe that Breyers Peach is not available within a 50 mile radius of Miami when, in fact, it is readily available in the local large Hispanic Sedano's and Presidente supermarket chains.
As to the peach ice cream itself, I don't think it declined as badly as some reviewers say when it went from ice cream to dairy dessert. It's still the best peach ""ice cream"" available in my book."

I was in the store and picked up vanilla and my all time favorite peach. What have you done to the ice cream? It is awful. It does not taste the same. It is not nearly as creamy or delicious. It taste like an off brand copycat. I might as well buy a store brand. You have lost a customer. Vanilla is just as awful.

It was like eating warm Cool Whip. I had about a cup of it and threw it out to the raccoons who gave me the stink eye and wouldn't eat it. They eat other ice creams, but this, they wouldn't eat at all. Neither would the opossums! Usually Breyers is very good, but this peach crud is very disappointing. If I could give it a minus 5 stars, I would. And, why in the heck is all of my personal information necessary to send this? Just as crappy as the ice cream! Really? One of the selections of where I buy is a beauty retailer? Really? And, what influences my purchases? Why do you need that????? Yeah, I have ice cream for breakfast! Who makes up these questions????"
20_breyers,CeeGee1984,2019-01-10,4,"Only a 3, but a 5 when I add cream",0,0,"It's not ice CREAM any more, probably because Breyer's feels pressure to lower the fat content. Big mistake, in my opinion. And it seems like they have amped up the sweetness too (not the peach sugar though). But I buy cream and pour it over the peach ice cream (like choc sauce on a sundae) and it gets back to being like the old stuff.
Alternatively ... lots of thawed, low-sweetened frozen peaches over Breyer Vanilla!"
20_breyers,Danny G,2020-07-21,5,Move over Bluebell,0,0,When i was a child Breyers was considered the best ice cream you could buy. I can recall that the parents would have that and us kids would have the cheaper version. As an adult I had become a huge bluebell fan banana split to be exact. Then there was the bluebell scare of 2015 and it was gone from the shelves. Well as disappointing as that was it put me in a position to revisit Breyers and I was pleased to find that it was better than i recalled and when the other ice cream company decided to take food safety into consideration it was too late I was back in the fold today my favorite is peach unfortunately it has been removed from the shelves at my local publix. I looked on here to see where I may find my favorite ice cream and it says Walmart. I have checked there as well and they had peach cobbler which is good also but not quite what I am into. Hopefully I am able to find it around at one of the other grocers in my area.

In addition, I thought the former Carbsmart formula tasted much better. Many, many people on the low carb forums are writing about this. Please bring back the old formula. If cost is a factor, I know that many of us would be willing to pay a little more for a specialty ice cream."

I bought some a while back and had a stockpile in the freezer.. Two different nutrition labels!!! I am on a KETO diet, this was the ONLY ice cream I have bought for 4 years. To find out that you nearly DOUBLED the net carbs is a horrible decision! I can no longer ""afford"" this in my diet as I only consume 10-15 carbs a day.. I feel betrayed! BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!!!!!"

I was skeptical of the ice cream after trying another (much more expensive) brand. Chocolate ice cream has always been my favorite and this ice cream did not let this diabetic down!! Thank you Breyers for this wonderful ice cream!!! I can enjoy a favorite and not have to worry about carbs. And let me emphasize, ENJOY. Now, can you try making a low carb hot fudge??"

The ""new"" recipe is HORRIBLE !! Why change something that was good !? It's higher in fat but has NO ""mouth feel"" of richness anymore. Nasty artificial sweetener taste. First ingredients listed are the ones most in the formula. Used to be ""milk and cream"" and now it's water and chemicals ! Shame on you. Never buying it again. BEWARE !!"
22_breyers,Raeanne,2019-05-02,5,Carbs,2,0,First of all not sure how people are saying there are 18 carbs in the ice cream. To get the correct carb count you have to subtract the fiber and alcohol sugars from the carbs and that is the true carb count. Just wish there were more flavors

My diabetic friends told me to avoid this but I thought I'd try one package. Sure enough, the ice ""cream"" is thin and icy, not creamy at all. Good low card and diabetic ice cream is NEVER low-cal. Here they used too much milk (which has more lactose sugar than cream, especially <yech> skim) and the taste is watery, not thick at all. Why is it no major manufacturer can make a decent low-carb or diabetic ice cream? It would be a winner."
22_breyers,Julia,2018-04-08,5,My favorite!,1,0,It’s seriously the best ice cream and you can’t tell it’s low in sugar. It’s creamy and very addictive. I’ve only tried the chocolate and not sure I can muster up the strength to try a different one because I love this one!!! Difficult to find in my nearby grocery stores though. I shall work on that!

Then I tried the chocolate and fell totally in love with the chocolate. Now I can join the family for dessert and I actually have a choice of which Carb Smart flavor to have. And then, my husband brought home Carb Smart Peanut butter by accident (the picture looks a lot like vanilla if you don't look carefully) and I was totally hooked--it is sublime! Please don't make a mint chocolate chip with Hershey's sugar free chocolate morsels. You may find me hidden away in a dark closet with a container of Carb Smart mint chocolate chip and a big spoon. I would be rendered helpless!"
23_breyers,Clw7550,2019-07-17,1,Disappointed,13,0,"Was very excited when I saw this new flavor as I love peanut butter ice cream. Texture / mouth feel was fantastic. Very creamy, much more than what I expected from a low carb ice cream. However I found the flavor extremely lacking, the ice cream was very bland and had little to no peanut butter flavor. There was a small swirl of peanut butter in the container however it was way too small for the size of the container and many scoops of ice cream had no peanut butter swirl at all. Will not buy again."
23_breyers,rose,2020-01-30,1,Bring back the swirl!!,24,0,"I'd buy six or eight cartons of this every single time I saw it on the shelves. I'm not joking when I say that this wonderful treat made my first year as a diabetic bearable, and helped me get my AC-1 down to 5. It was as good as any 'real' ice cream, with those thick, salty swirls of peanut butter blending so perfectly with the sweet, slightly peanut buttery ice cream.
Well, the swirl is gone and I'm devastated. My favourite treat is dead! I couldn't believe my eyes when I scooped into my new carton and found it uniform. The sweetness and subtle flavour that blended so well with those yummy swirls is just painfully generic on its own. Less flavour than Vanilla.
I'll be switching to another brand's no sugar added options until the swirls come back. Can't describe how disappointed I am. There are so few options as a diabetic and the old recipe was such a standout. Now? Not so much."

#2 Why is it that the local stores seldom have Carb Smart available.?

23_breyers,Colin,2020-02-20,1,Amazing ice cream until they ruined it,1,0,"Much like many others, I was absolutely in love with this ice cream, as were my parents. Both me and my mom would regularly buy multiple cartons at a time because we loved the creamyness of the ice cream mixed with the tougher texture and stronger flavor of the peanut butter swirls.
When we found some cartons without the swirls and just containing a plain cube of ice cream with a dull flavor, we both just prayed that it was an older recipe and the newer ones contained the swirls because Breyers understood it was an improvement.
I am truly baffled to find out that the plain cartons were the new recipe. Just why? It's painfully boring now. I still buy them on the off chance I get one with swirls, which is easily a no-brainer 5-star ice cream. Hopefully they come to their senses and revert the horrible mistake they've made."
23_breyers,Rich222,2020-02-09,1,The swirl is worth 4 more stars,2,0,Came here to voice my dissatisfaction with everyone else. Bring back the previous formulation for 5 stars. Currently tastes like vanilla with a hint of peanut butter. Didn’t even finish the current gallon I have and will not ever purchase this current formulation again.
23_breyers,Carol770,2020-02-10,1,#bring back the swirl!!!,1,0,"I've been purchasing & enjoying your delicious Carb Smart ice creams for some time now. Although the chocolate & vanilla are very good, the Peanut Butter is far & away THE BEST! I recently bought a carton with no peanut butter swirl & at first I thought it was a mistake. Then I noticed your packaging changed as well - no swirl. So disappointing, flavor is poor without the best part. Why did you remove it? Please bring back the swirl!"
23_breyers,Josh85,2020-01-27,1,I agree with all the other OUTRAGED customers!,2,0,This ice cream was the BEST low carb half gallon money could buy.......UNTIL they took out the Peanut Butter swirl!!! WHY!!??? If they don't add it back I am not going to buy it any more.....
23_breyers,Cruesinner,2020-02-05,1,Bring back the peanut butter swirl!,1,0,The first time I bought this ice cream I thought it was fantastic...because it had the peanut butter swirl. I occasionally buy Rebel low carb ice cream but I bought the Brewers this time because it was on sale. As soon as I took the first scoop I was wondering where the peanut butter swirl was. It does not taste like peanut butter and I won’t buy this again. Obviously everyone else here is missing the peanut butter swirl again.
23_breyers,HappyInFlorida,2020-03-11,5,Soooo...,0,0,"I just bought this today and tried it tonight and I am VERY happy. However, I just went online to check the nutritional facts and came across this website. I started to read the reviews and all of them say the say thing that there wasnt any Peanut Butter Swirl in their cartons. Well, they must have listened because my carton is full of Peanut Butter Swirls and tastes just like real Peanut Butter Ice Cream. I am VERY pleased with this as I went out on a limb when I purchased it tonight without knowing what it tasted like first. I am on a keto-esque diet and this is going to replace my normal high sugar desserts I am always craving. I'm very very happy with this product, and I can only assume that they went back to the original recipe."
23_breyers,marty,2019-10-06,1,flavor doesn't taste right,2,0,This is not very tasty. There is an odd taste that isn't like l peanut butter. Too creamy
23_breyers,jimbo56,2020-01-24,1,"missing the swirl, too",1,0,"Just finished half of the carton looking for the swirl (the only flavor source in the recipe.) Threw the rest away! Not even a warning on the front like ""New Recipe"" or ""Now with less flavor."" Will not be purchasing again. You fooled me this time...but not again! I work too hard for my money to waste it on this."
23_breyers,Smiley,2020-01-07,5,I love the peanut butter chunks that are in this,1,0,"I absolutely love the peanut butter! I have lost 27 pounds going to low carb and I eat 3 scoops of this every day as a treat. We recently noticed the peanut butter has changed and no more chunks in it. Needless to say, it’s not as good now. So sad they changed this. Still good but not near as good as it was."
23_breyers,Matt cat,2020-08-04,1,Ribbon gone,0,0,As with most low carb dieters I loved this product when it was first tried with the pea nut butter ribbon. The product itself is ok but the ribbon made it great. Paying a bit more is not an issue for someone on low carb when the treat is good enough because there are so few options. Fortunately that is changing and I’m hoping executives revisit their stance on this products recipe before the sales diminish to a point where the line is eliminated. You have an opportunity to capture more market share and help keep upstarts out of the frozen treat space. Many of us find this without advertising. Imaging what will occur to sales if it is realized this is not just for low carb dieters but also is reasonable for those with diabetes. Please consider making the treat the way it was.
23_breyers,Lawdog71,2020-03-03,1,Where is the swirl???,0,0,I have been buying your Peanut Butter Carb Smart ice cream for the past year and a half. I have been on this Keto diet and found that I could still love good ice cream and not rack up on carbs. The swirl is what made the ice cream. Big chunks of peanut butter that would literally melt in your mouth. But now some genius has taken it out and it is just plain ole peanut butter ice cream. I will be looking for another brand seeing that this flavor was all I ever bought. Thanks for the disappointment.
23_breyers,Don83,2019-02-27,5,"Tastes great, not chalky like some other brands.",1,0,"I’m trying low carb and biggest issue is my love of ice cream. Tried this peanut butter flavor, and I think I can stick to this longer after this discovery. The other brands have some real chalky tastes. Glad Breyers is helping with not being like that..."
23_breyers,Zippie,2020-04-21,1,Horrible without the peanut butter swirl,1,0,It’s horrible without the swirl bring it back. Loved it with the swirl. Came here to see what was going on because I have still been getting the swirl ever once in awhile. We only shop at 2 store. Try rotating the stock if you’re gonna change it.
23_breyers,Kimberly,2020-02-10,3,Bring back the swirl,1,0,The peanut butter fudge like swirl makes the ice cream a real winner. Why did you take it out? Please add it back. I am a 30 plus year dedicated Breyers customer. I know icecream.
23_breyers,rhondat1000,2020-02-07,1,The swirl is gone!,1,0,I used to love this with the peanut butter swirl. Why would you take out the best part? I will never buy it again unless you go back to the original recipe. So disappointed!
23_breyers,Kittykat67,2019-04-23,5,Tastes deliciously peanut buttery!,1,0,I had been searching for a lower calorie peanut butter ice cream without chocolate in it. Didn’t think one existed then spotted this at Walmart! I love it!!!
23_breyers,Sadaboutbreyers,2020-02-20,1,WHY??? did you remove the peanut butter swirls??,1,0,Why would you remove the peanut butter swirls from the ice cream? It no longer tastes like peanut butter? Cost savings??? So disappointing...
23_breyers,Randlar,2020-06-24,5,Add a banana!,1,0,"I really like this low carb line. The peanut butter is my favorite, especially with slices of banana."

23_breyers,Sandy50,2020-04-28,4,Peanu butter swirl,0,0,"This is my favorite low carb ice cream but several time I have bought it and there was no peanut butter swirls in it. I called the first time and breyers sent me 3 coupons for free ice cream which was a good thing. However, last month I had the same thing happen so I am wondering how often this actually does occur. I did not call breyers the second time but I am feeling leary about buying any more of it. When the peanut butter is in it it is delicious"
23_breyers,Twitterbug,2020-05-30,3,Good but Could be better,0,0,I was very happy that Meijer had another flavor of carb smart ice cream. There is one complaint that I have with it. It needs more salt I couldn't figure out why it was so bland and then I sprinkled a little bit of salt on my bowl of ice cream and it made all the world of difference. it would be better if the salt was mixed in the ice cream though if you could consider adding salt to it I think that would be a big improvement.
23_breyers,joyase,2020-05-26,1,YOU RUINED IT!,0,0,"WHY did you change what was my favorite low carb ice cream ever?!? as others have complained, it is HORRIBLE without the ribbons/swirls of peanut butter. that made it over the top delicious & I was raving to everyone about it. so they tried it & also hate it because you removed what made it great. SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED & WILL NO LONGER BUY ANY OF YOUR LOW CARB PRODUCTS."
23_breyers,train jockey,2020-02-20,3,This is About the Swirl,0,0,"I love the new Breyers Peanut Butter Ice Cream that came out. Eating only chocolate and vanilla gets boring. The problem I have is about the swirl that flows through the container. In the beginning, the swirl was all in ice cream, but now 60% of the containers do not have any swirl. When get one that has the swirl on top, I know its through the container."
23_breyers,Terri,2019-04-22,5,Love it,0,0,Seen the new Breyers peanut butter in the store yesterday and just had to try it! OMG....so yummy! My husband and I only buy the Breyers low carb ice cream so it was nice to have a different flavor than chocolate and vanilla. Makes an awesome peanut butter shake! Keep up the good work!
23_breyers,BooSandee,2019-10-02,4,Thank Goodness,0,1,Its nice to have a creamy delicious alternative when living a low carb lifestyle. I have been partaking of the vanilla CarbSmart flavor for some time and would often mix peanut butter into it. Imagine my delight when I saw the new peanut butter flavor. Absolutely delicious!

I LOVE it, wonderful flavor, the swirls that run through give this ice cream give such a lovely, peanut-y flavor. I think it's already very popular, very few left on the shelf! Thumbs up."
23_breyers,REITdude,2020-03-19,2,"Low Sugar, Not Low Carb",0,0,"Tastes good BUT look carefully at the label: ""5 Grams Total Sugar Per Serving"", not to be confused with 5 Grams Net Carbs. The simple math is Total Carbs (17) minus Sugar Alcohol (7) = 10 Grams, of which 5 is sugar. Not as low carb as you would hope!"
23_breyers,Nonna,2020-06-25,5,My favorite!,0,0,I love this ice cream! I really like that the peanut butter is in crunchy streaks in the ice cream. That it is a healthier ice cream version is a win-win!! My only problem is that I am having trouble finding this item in stock in my local stores!

I've been to 2 Krogers and 3 Publix stores today and not a single one of them even has a section in the freezer reserved for Breyers Lactose Free CHOCOLATE Frozen Dessert. We don't care for the vanilla. Maybe that's why all the stores have vanilla in their freezers. We're having withdrawal issues because we can't find our favorite, guilt-free, healthy ""ice cream."" Please help us. We resorted to buying the vanilla tonight and it's not satisfying. Our pup loves both flavors, but from his reaction, he seems to prefer the chocolate. He's got great taste.

One thing we love most about Breyers is the creaminess! A lot of other ice cream brands are gritty but not Breyers, it's thick and smooth and you can taste the chunks of strawberry in it and it's sooo good! Our family of 7 would definitely recommend Breyers ice cream!"
25_breyers,Ames1234,2017-07-28,4,Tasty Ice Cream,1,2,"I typically do not like strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream combined because I find the strawberry flavor to be overpowering. This Breyers ice cream is the perfect balance of all three flavors combined. The strawberry flavor has chunks of strawberry, which adds some texture to the ice cream. The chocolate and vanilla are very creamy. It is a smooth and creamy ice cream. What I also enjoyed about it was that the ice cream didn't melt too fast. The only thing that I didn't like about the ice cream is the chunks of strawberry. They were a little too big and because they're frozen they are hard and chewy."
25_breyers,sindymac,2017-07-20,5,Great Taste,4,0,I already buy the Neapolitan Breyers ice cream. I love it because it is not overly creamy.

I looked at the ingredients and it was colored pink with beet juice and called strawberry. It is really gross. The picture on the carton was very deceiving, it showed strawberries in the ice cream and there are NO strawberries but it is called strawberry. In fact in the list of ingredients strawberry is not there???????? Very disappointed!"
25_breyers,Electricman,2017-09-07,1,Disappointed,2,0,"To whom it may concern:
It is with sadness that I find it necessary to write a letter to an ice cream company that has held a much favored standing among competing dairy businesses. I believed that your brand of frozen treat was very tasty at the least.
We see that things have changed. First, we get less quality in your packaged ice cream. I just figured out that the rich taste is gone or there has been a chain of poorly mixed batches sold. Perhaps air or ice water was mixed into the box I bought. Second, we get less volume at higher cost. It looks as though you are doing us a favor by telling us, all over the box, how natural and GMO free it is. However, what ever your complements, we know you short us on weight, volume, and quality.
I might just as well start buying the cheap brands, it's all about the same.
The box we bought was :

25_breyers,adeeuh,2017-07-28,4,This Is How All Ice Cream Should Be,0,2,"Do you know what I love best about Breyer's take on the classic Neapolitan ice cream? It's that you can pronounce every item on the list of ingredients. There's something about eating naturally sourced products that makes you want to give yourself a pat on the back. Have at it! The texture was smooth and creamy and it's packed with natural flavor (real strawberries, people!). The next time I've having a craving for ice cream, I'll be grabbing one from Breyer's non-GMO selection. My go-to favorite brand has officially been retired."
25_breyers,ErinMc,2017-07-23,5,Sooooo good!,1,0,"Breyer's vanilla has always been among my favorite vanillas (my go-to flavor), but the Neapolitan is great for everyone in the family. My older son and I can have vanilla, while my younger son has chocolate (his favorite), and my husband mixes both chocolate and strawberry. The flavors are all good, and fun to mix-and-match. Will definitely be buying again!"
25_breyers,castello,2017-07-16,4,Breyers Vanilla/Chocolate/Strawberry,1,0,"Ok, so this ice cream is like a blast from my childhood, my Mom bought this flavor all of the time. Its rich and creamy, the vanilla taste like real vanilla, the chocolate tastes like chocolate and the strawberry tastes like you just picked them. So I say yum, its delicious~"
25_breyers,MaryH,2018-03-14,5,Every once in a while I need this!,1,0,I’ve always loved Breyer’s product but since becoming diabetic I have to limit sugar. This is a great substitute for ice cream. No weird after taste. Just plain good. Wish I could find it more places.
25_breyers,tallen2999,2017-09-06,5,This is real ice cream!,0,0,"I was excited to try Breyers Vanilla/Chocolate/Strawberry ice cream as I have enjoyed this flavor combination in the past. This product did not let me down. First, when you look at the ingredient list you can see it contains real ingredients which you can pronounce which is huge in my book. In the vanilla you can taste the real vanilla bean flavor and not some artificial taste that some ""frozen dairy desserts"" try to sell you. In the strawberry these are real strawberries that taste as if they were recently picked. The chocolate tastes like real chocolate. The ice cream itself is creamy and all three flavors work in unison instead of making you want to take just one flavor and throw away the rest. I would highly recommend this ice cream to someone who wants a refreshing treat on a hot or cold day."
25_breyers,rlh190,2017-07-26,5,Honestly good stuff!,0,0,"Breyers Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry ice cream is very tasty. Just as important to me is that it be made with good ingredients and looking at the label I was pleasantly surprised - there is a short list of ingredients and there is NO high fructose corn syrup. There are plenty of good, natural flavors! These creamy natural flavors shine through. We had been looking for a good quality ice cream this summer with little luck until we tried this one, and Breyers fits the bill!"
25_breyers,cindybn1958,2017-07-26,5,Breyers Ice Cream,0,0,"I recently purchased Breyers ice cream, and I was pleasantly surprised at how creamy and tasty this ice cream is. The flavors are nice and strong but not overpowering, the ice cream was light and creamy. It was easy to get out of the container without struggling with a hard scoop. The vanilla flavor had incredible vanilla taste as did the strawberry and chocolate. I was so impressed that I went and purchased another flavor when it went on sale the following week."
25_breyers,belsmom,2017-07-28,4,Very tasty ice cream !,0,0,"Breyer's Neapolitan Ice Cream is one of my FAVES! The flavors are delicious! My favorite of the 3 is vanilla. Breyer's uses REAL ingredients.. cream.. vanilla beans.. strawberries and cocoa, so I am comfortable feeding this to my daughter and without worrying about ""other"" ingredients that I'm not able to pronounce. The creamy texture is a treat to your mouth and of course it's summer so it helps to cool you off! I would buy this over and over again and will!"
25_breyers,Laurbor,2017-07-31,5,Rich creamy goodness,0,0,I love Bryers ice cream any time of year. The flavors are great and the ingredients are top quality. Hey have the best peanut butter chocolate ice cream ever! The ratio of smooth creamy peantibutter and chocolate ice cream are perfection. If you love sweet and salty try this flavor. It's not expensive and so worth it. I also love that their ice cream lasts a lot longer without quickly getting freezer burn.
25_breyers,joe1950,2017-11-04,1,Strawberry flavor IceCream taste really bad,1,1,The Strawberry ice cream taste really bad . There was no taste of strawberry it taste really bad. The chocolate and vanilla ice cream tasted good . I don't know why it tasted so bad like those strawberry Protein Shakes bad
25_breyers,Neenerwags,2017-09-06,5,Always a Classic!,0,0,"I remember my Mom buying Breyers Neopolitan ice cream when I was a kid because everyone had a different favorite flavor in our house. I find that the same holds true for my own family now. I always liked all three; chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, and Breyers doesn't disappoint on any of them. The vanilla tastes like real vanilla, the chocolate is nice and rich, and the strawberry is very flavorful (not fake tasting like so many other brands out there). I am so glad that Breyers simplified their ingredients and still makes great tasting flavors. Overall the ice cream had a rich and creamy consistency too, which is always necessary when it comes to quality ice cream. My family really enjoyed eating the three different flavors, and for me it was like being a kid again. I would definitely recommend this ice cream, especially to bring to a gathering so that everyone gets a flavor that they like."
25_breyers,Lasdionne,2017-09-06,5,Classic neopolitan ice cream!,0,0,"I think this classic ice cream, now GMO-free, is a summer staple! After being inundated with new and trendy flavors over the last year, it's refreshing to return back to enjoying the staples- chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. This particular ice cream is creamy enough without being too heavy, and all three flavors are equal in flavor strength."
25_breyers,Jana,2017-10-31,5,low calorie,1,1,I just love that one; you can have 3 flavors in 1.
25_breyers,Nitav75,2017-07-17,5,Breyers Ice cream review,0,0,"I finally bought Breyers Vanilla,Chocolate, Strawberry ice cream and I loved it. I haven't tasted such natural and flavorful ice cream in a long time. It makes me feel the lack of GMO ingredients made a big difference. I also like that it has no artificial ingredients. Great job Breyers!!!"
25_breyers,kimbanurse14,2017-07-26,5,Perfect ice cream with a flavor for all!,0,0,"We tried the Breyers vanilla chocolate and strawberry and so good! Creamy and smooth but not heavy. Vanilla is always a fave, the strawberries were blended perfectly and the chocolate was just the right chocolate for ice cream! Perfect dessert for our summer dinner on the deck!"
25_breyers,LittleAthens,2017-07-14,5,Who doesn't like ice cream,0,1,Rich and creamy with all natural ingredients. Perfect for that hot summer day or any occasion. I love that they have a lot of varieties to choose from. It does tend to melt faster im guessing because it's all natural but gives me a reason to gobble it up
25_breyers,lonehuntress,2017-07-14,5,STILL AMAZING!,0,0,Breyer's has always been a favorite since childhood. My grandmother used to buy the vanilla bean flavored ice cream and it's still my absolute favorite. The flavor is so lushious and rich and the ice cream itself is creamy and smooth. The best ever!
25_breyers,jillsco12,2018-02-13,5,Glad to have it!,0,0,"I can't have much sugar in my diet so im just happy to have something that is a treat that I can actually eat. This gets rid of my sugar craving. I'm easy to please, but I love this stuff and I recommend it to people with limited sugar intake."
25_breyers,greenbeank,2017-07-26,4,Vanilla love,0,0,"I love the vanilla bean flavor of this ice cream. It's creamy and unlike much vanilla ice cream out there, this one actually tastes like real vanilla! The texture is smooth too, which makes it a great summer treat!"
25_breyers,SilverWolf696,2017-08-07,3,Breyers Neapolitan Ice Cream,0,0,"So I have never been a fan of Neapolitan Ice Cream as I don't generally like Strawberry and in the sense that this was not a strong Strawberry the ice cream worked for me. On the fact it's supposed to be Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry ice cream, it was kind of a fail as the Strawberry gets lost in the Vanilla and Chocolate which are both much more dominate in the flavor palate. Overall it's not a bad Ice Cream and the packaging is very clear and I appreciate the fact that it's from non-GMO sources materials, though no where that I could find does it say Gluten-free, which is a concern to me as I have a pretty bad allergy to it and as an ice cream with no gluten in it supposedly, I don't understand why Breyers wouldn't want it to appeal to the buyers. For the price though, you do get a lot of ice cream and it's got a good creamy consistency without being too hard or icy. I can't really give this higher than 3 stars though as I've had better and this just didn't seem to be a standout, even alongside the other options that Breyers carries but it is a good solid ice cream."
25_breyers,859m,2017-11-15,5,Breyers ice cream,0,0,I use to go to the factory when I was a kid in philadelphia and get free ice cream that were I feel in love with the best ice cream ever. this was in the early 1950 s

26_breyers,Mari,2018-04-07,5,Amazing!!,21,1,"Because I have an allergy to milk products, my dessert choices are limited. I was pleased to find this ice cream in my local grocery store and decided to give it a try. I was skeptical at first because all the non-dairy desserts I had tried before were not that great. But wow, Breyers! This ice cream was absolutely amazing -- it was as creamy and delicious as regular ice cream. I think the almond milk in it gives it a subtle flavor that doesn't overpower the vanilla or peanut butter flavors. And I liked that this ice cream is made with natural ingredients. Thank you Breyers! I hope that you'll continue to make this ice cream and add more flavors."
26_breyers,Anonymous,2017-07-26,5,Better Ice Cream,11,0,"Almond milk instead of dairy means a kinder product. Kinder to the cows, of course, but also to the environment and our health. As for taste, YUM! My husband, myself, and the kiddo got three spoons - one for each of us - and finished it together in one sitting. The peanut butter swirl was just right. Not overpowering or 'gummy'. The plain vanilla part, by itself, was a bit bland but as it's meant to be eaten with the peanut butter, just right when both are on the spoon! The texture would fool any creamy dairy lover. Can't tell the difference. All three of us agree there will be more of this in our future."
26_breyers,HollyB,2017-07-12,5,Exceptional,16,0,"I was happily surprised to find this in my local grocery store. I've been dairy-free for well over a decade and tried many different alternative frozen desserts. This is, by far, the best non-dairy ice cream. It's silky and creamy in texture and the flavor is simply that Breyers vanilla I've always loved, swirled with ribbons of peanut butter. Not only is it delicious, but the ingredient list is short and sweet and completely recognizable. Thank you for making non-dairy additions to your product line! I hope to see more flavors (gluten-free as well, please!) in the future."
26_breyers,ozopixq,2018-06-07,5,My new favorite ice cream! ♡,1,0,"I don't usually leave reviews, but this ice cream was amazing! I have tried a lot of other non-dairy ice creams before, but none of them were anything special. I thought I would try out this new product and I was shocked how good it is! It's not too sweet, the peanut butter swirls have a hint of salty and the almond flavor is perfect with it. This texture is just like dairy ice cream, absolutely perfect. I will definitely be buying this product again! :D"
26_breyers,hogiesmom,2020-06-07,5,Yummy Goodness,7,0,"My daughter I have issues with lactose, so we were excited to see that Breyers has new non-dairy ice cream that's made with Almond Milk. My daughter and I like Breyers Ice Cream, so we can't help sneaking a small bowl of dairy ice cream even though we know we'll pay for it. Now we get to have Breyers and feel great about eating it! The ice cream was very smooth, creamy and tasty. It scooped out easily. The only problem with it is that it was gone too soon! My husband found the container and finished it on us, Both my daughter and I have recommended the new non-dairy Breyers to other people we know with tummy troubles, but this is an ice cream that everyone can enjoy. Just ask my husband!"
26_breyers,Grammy Laurel,2018-04-22,5,Non-dairy ice cream,4,0,Real excited to see your new peanut butter flavor nondairy ice cream in our store today. It's not my favorite flavor but it has an excellent vanilla base. (Glad you're not using coconut milk like so many others )I found the cookie and cream to be too sweet and not refreshing. I'm hoping that you will try some more nondairy flavors. I would love to see a vanilla almond milk base with cherry and possibly vegan dark chocolate chunks… Breyers has always had the best vanilla and the best ice cream and I appreciate that you have not jacked up the price like other brands for nondairy ice cream! Thank you!
26_breyers,Chad L,2017-07-31,5,THANK YOU AND WELL DONE BREYERS!!!,15,0,"My husband is allergic to gluten, dairy, soy, and rice. Therefore his desert options are limited. He has tried all of the non-dairy, gluten free, soy free options on the market. He likes a couple of them, but has said many times you can tell its not real ice cream. Also you only get a pint for around $6. BREYERS has beat all the competition in the non-dairy treat race...even Been and Jerry's (who puts soy in theirs). This ice cream is creamy and smooth, easy to scoop and absolutely delicious. Our son did not believe that it wasn't real dairy ice cream. Not only does it have the best flavor and texture, it also has the best price. A full quart for the same price as all the pints. Thank you BREYERS and please keep the non-dairy, gluten free, soy free ice cream ideas coming. More flavors please."
26_breyers,thekingskourt,2017-07-31,4,How sweet it is!,4,0,"Overall, I have to say that Breyer's Nondairy Vanilla with peanut butter grozen dessert is very good. It has the same texture as a ""real"" ice cream. The peanut butter swirl's flavor is excellent. However, the vanilla ice cream made from almond milk is overly sweet for my taste. In fact, my mom was there when I tried it and my first words were. ""Oh wow, that's really sweet."" And not in a good way. The peanut butter isn't very sweet though, so if you get a spoonful with both, it's pretty tasty."
26_breyers,ReebsH,2017-07-26,5,Creamy and delicious,6,0,"As someone who loves ice cream, I'm a hard sell on non-dairy frozen treats, but the Breyers Non-Dairy Vanilla Peanut Butter was delicious. The vanilla was at first bite a bit intense but it really mellowed with the peanut butter, which is actual peanut butter. It is extremely creamy and the consistency was just like regular ice cream. I will definitely be trying the other Breyers Non-Dairy flavor."
26_breyers,Ember,2018-01-07,5,Great flavor and texture!,1,0,"I have been dairy free for a year now. As someone who used to eat ice cream almost every day, finding a good substitute was pretty important to me. This is the first dairy free ice cream I’ve found that tastes like ice cream, and has the correct texture. It isn’t rock hard like many dairy free ice creams. It doesn’t have an almond taste (the almond base is actually undetectable, unlike many other brands!) I would love to see more dairy free flavors, hopefully more gluten and dairy free ones (I have a lot of food allergies haha) this df ice cream made me want to cry, I’ve missed ice cream so much!!"
26_breyers,MilaJulz,2018-03-09,5,Best ever!,1,0,We love this ice cream! So good! My daughters have milk allergies and this is not only delicious but very reasonably priced! Thank you!
26_breyers,Jessiekaj,2017-07-08,5,Omg amazing,6,0,I wish there were more flavors. Very creamy unlike some of the other non dairy icecreams. So good
26_breyers,Shelbs85,2017-08-18,5,HEAVEN!,3,0,"I feel like no words can do justice to how delicious this is! When I was a kid, I used to literally swirl peanut butter into my ice cream, and as soon as I tried this, it was like getting in a time machine:) So, so, sooo good! It's also half the calories of another peanut butter non-dairy ice cream that's not even half as peanut buttery and delicious."
26_breyers,Nomilkhappytummy,2018-06-29,5,Must Have It!,0,0,"Being lactose-intolerant, I had pretty much given up on ice cream, which made me very sad. I have used almond milk many years now and was so excited to see Breyers Almond Milk ice cream! I'm not a big Cookies & Cream fan so I decided to try the Peanut Butter Swirl, even though I really wasn't sure I'd like that. Oh wow, was I in for a wonderful surprise! It tastes delicious and not like some ""fake"" ice cream at all! My only problem with it has been finding it lately! When I first tried it there were several stores in my area that carried it. Now I can't find any and I am super disappointed! Please tell me you aren't discontinuing it! I'd love to see even more varieties, especially one with caramel!"
26_breyers,Veronica,2020-07-15,5,THE LITERAL BEST,0,0,"Tried your Cookies and Cream non-dairy last time and it was the best non-dairy ice cream I'd ever had, and now second only to this one (so long, Ben & Jerry's). So happy to see Breyers expanding their products to encompass more dietary restrictions/choices. My whole family agrees it's just as good as (if not better than) normal ice cream and it's going to become a staple in our freezer.
Two suggestions when you decide to expand your selection:
1. something with a coconut/soy/oat base for people with nut allergies or who are wary of almonds' environmental footprint
2. Chocolate????"
26_breyers,jemartin89,2017-07-29,5,Very Reasonably Priced Vegan Ice Cream!,2,0,"This vegan ice cream has a nice creamy flavor from the coconut milk, and a great price too. I've seen vegan ice creams with similar flavor for $7 or $8 a pint. A big container of this gives you a lot more for your money. Great flavor, decent quality, and great value. I didn't think it would be good with just the peanut butter and vanilla flavors, but it actually tastes great!"
26_breyers,GFDFEF,2018-02-13,5,Tastes like ice cream,2,0,"So pleased to find a non-dairy frozen product in Walmart at a reasonable price. And it has a pleasant taste. Could have less sugar but not complaining. Came right to Breyers website to see what other flavors are offered. Alas! the one other flavor has gluten and I can't do gluten either. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do some other flavors that are gluten free, dairy free and egg free."
26_breyers,Anonymous,2017-08-28,5,Fantastic!!,2,0,"I knew at some point Breyer's would get in the non-dairy game and I am overly pleased that you've finally done it!! This ice cream is amazing...smooth, creamy and easy to scoop. As an added bonus you put the peanut butter in for me already and it too is delicious! Thanks a million for adding to our non-dairy ice cream options. I see a lot of it in our future!"
26_breyers,SnowAngel,2018-09-15,5,yea for peanut butter vanilla.,0,0,"A few years ago I went Dairy- free because i started have problems with dairy. I missed ice creams and i found one dairy free one i liked but i could not always find it or i found just the small one or had to make my own. Then about a year ago i came across this one and i picked it up and read it, i was a little concerned about the almond milk since i not like almonds or almond milk but I was willing to try it and i just loved it and even tried the cookie one too. Even my parents and brother liked it, and the fact that it was half a gallon is great. So please continue to make your dairy-free ice creams and add more flavors please, i had to stop getting it so i would not get burned out on it is how much i like it."
26_breyers,MadiRuth,2017-08-18,5,HANDS DOWN THE BEST NON-DAIRY CHOICE,3,1,"This is literally my favorite non-dairy ice cream! Having developed a milk allergy, I haven't been able to eat ""normal"" ice cream for some time now (which growing up, I loved ice cream). I have tried many many maaaaaaany other options that just were not cutting my craving! Well.... Thank you Breyers for making something creamy and delicious that actually tastes like ice cream!"

26_breyers,ctbeanie,2017-07-29,4,Wow! Not what we expected,2,0,"The kids were a little Leary of ""non-dairy"" but I have to say that this Breyers non-dairy changed their minds. The texture was smooth, the flavor was fabulous and they had to admit that they really liked it! We definitely would try it again!"
26_breyers,kkbanana,2017-11-01,5,Delicious!!,2,0,"Most almond milk ice creams are expensive and have more of an icy texture. This is smooth, creamy and really good. I wish they had more flavors, as I'm also gluten free and have only tried the peanut butter. I will be getting more!"
26_breyers,feebz7,2017-09-06,3,A good alternative e,1,0,"The flavor overall was pretty good. A little sweeter than I like for myself, but my kids enjoyed it. My oldest liked it the first night and then said he didn't. I think that was because he read the label and of course if it is healthy or good for him, he does not like it anymore! Lol
My two younger one finished off the container without any problem! :)
If my regular non dairy brand was not avalible, I would pick this up as an alternative!"

26_breyers,Rsin,2017-08-31,5,Excellent for a Vegan.,1,0,"I became lactose intolerant about 8 years ago. And recently in the past 2 years have gone Vegan. Finding ice cream that taste like the ice cream I have bought in the past was a challenge. I have tried just about every non daily ice cream you can buy, and this is the closest to dairy ice cream I can find. Peanut Butter with a banana cut up is ace. Hope to see more flavors available sometime. Thanks for making this."
26_breyers,petuniakitty,2017-07-31,5,Just as good as real ice cream!,1,0,New product from Breyers dairy free ice cream in my opinion is just as good as their regular ice cream. I couldn't tell the difference it was just as creamy as the dairy version. I tried the peanut butter vanilla swirl and look forward to trying the other flavor Oreo cookies and cream. I appreciate the fact that they use recognizable ingredients and aren't full of chemicals.
26_breyers,renee,2017-07-29,5,MY NEW FAVORITE DESSERT!,1,0,I love the taste of this frozen dessert! The texture was silky smooth not chalky or icy like some non-dairy items. The peanut butter was delicious and just the right amount as to not overpower the base flavor. Please keep this item in high quantities at the local grocers as there was only one other container left after I purchased mine!
26_breyers,mitamia,2017-07-29,5,Awesome Non-Dairy Ice Cream,1,0,"I am really excited by the new non-dairy ice cream offerings by Breyers. I'm on a dairy-free diet per doctors orders and I find it extremely difficult. I love cheese and ice cream. I've tried dozens of non-dairy ice creams in the past and I'm usually disappointed. Most non-dairy ice creams are overly sweet and not at all creamy. I've even had some with a weird chemical aftertaste. Breyers non-dairy ice cream in the vanilla peanut butter flavor did not disappoint. The almond milk ice cream base was on point- nice and creamy, natural tasting, sweet vanilla flavor, but not overly sweet. The peanut butter was real as well which was a good salty balance to the sweet ice cream. I'll be honest, this ice cream would have been better with chocolate flavored ice cream because chocolate and peanut butter are a combo made in heaven. I am looking forward to trying the Oreo flavor next. I found my new ice cream- I couldn't be happier, especially for only 140 calories per serving."
26_breyers,Rakshasa,2019-08-20,5,Perfect ice cream ever !,0,0,"Thanks to breyers for your best ice cream dairy and gluten free of the world. I can eat correctly a dessert without gluten and dairy product with no stress cause I am hypersensitivity of gluten and dairy so a lot of product can be contain some allergen product like wheat , milk, soy or the product as been make in a same factory with wheat or milk product so I don't take chance to eat that so I would like to say Thanks full to breyers for giving to us a chance to eat a best dairy and gluten free ice cream ever !"

Superb, flavor and texture. Excellent value. Bravo."

I found out a year ago that I was allergic to milk and it's been a struggle to find things similar to enjoy. The alternative ice cream options are always so expensive and I can't bring myself to buy them. Then this appeared at my grocery store costing less than the other options with more ice cream to enjoy. Thank you so so much! I hope that more flavors continue to come out, and it's a plus if they're gluten free too!"

It has great flavor and texture and really tastes like real ice cream. Looking on Breyers website to see what other flavors are offered besides the Vanilla/Peanut Butter one and... the only other flavor has cookies in it. My kids said the Oreo one was delicious but, I can not do gluten, so, it's not a choice for me. PLEASE make some other flavors that are gluten free and, dairy free."
26_breyers,diamndgrrl,2017-08-05,4,This was a hit!,0,0,"My fiancé and I served this as dessert after dinner while my father and step mother were in town. My sister and brother-in-law were also here, all of whom drink almond milk in place of regular milk. The flavor was great. It was slightly less creamier than regular ice cream, but it is a delicious alternative. It was a definite hit. It is so much better than any other non-dairy alternative ice creams, and I think my family will definitely purchase it again!"

I have been a Breyers fan for years although I was upset when certain flavors became 'frozen dessert' instead of ice cream. I only bought the ice cream, but sure did miss butter pecan. I was absolutely delighted to find this product. Please make additional gluten free flavors vanilla/almond or dark chocolate chunks."
26_breyers,Taylor,2018-06-06,5,Seriously delicious,0,0,"I bought this ice cream not realizing it was dairy free. If I had, I never would have bought it. And man, would I have missed out. Had I not noticed when I opened it to try it a few days later, I would have never known it was dairy free. This is as delicious as any ice cream out there. I eat dairy all the time but will continue to buy this ice cream because it is that good. It’s not good for non-dairy ice cream, it’s just good. Plain and simple."

The competition is terrible and overpriced."

As a kid I grew up eating ice cream in the summers, but as I got older my intolerance to lactose got in the way. I've tried other non-dairy brands but they lacked taste.

26_breyers,kutztown46,2017-10-22,4,Best Frozen Almond Milk So Far,0,0,"First, I am very grateful that Breyers and others are offering products to those of us who are on dairy-free diets. I am age 61, and just within the last year I developed an intolerance to dairy products. It is good to know that I do not have to give up ""ice cream"" for the rest of my life!
I have tried only one other frozen almond milk product. I would rate the Breyers product as slightly better. And the competitive product sells for the same price at my grocery store as this product, but the competitive product is only one pint!
To be honest, while this Breyers product is very good and comes close to matching the texture of a good dairy ice cream, the taste tells you that it is something different - it is NOT ice cream.
My hope is that Breyers enters the frozen CASHEW milk market. There is a company that sells 5-10 different flavors of frozen cashew milk. I have tried almost all of them, and they are AMAZING! Unlike the frozen almond milk desserts, the frozen cashew milk products taste very much like a premium ice cream in every way. I am sure that if Breyers chose to enter this market, they could make an equally outstanding or even better product."

26_breyers,lheath315,2017-07-26,4,Perfect Summer Sweet!,0,0,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a non-dairy ice cream. In the past, they've had funny after-tastes or a grainy texture. I've stayed away from non-dairy ice cream for a couple of years because of previous experience, but I trusted my experience with Breyers and decided to try out the Non-Dairy Vanilla Peanut Butter ice cream.
It wasn't easy to find in the store. I looked for it in the Breyers section within the frozen foods at my local grocery store. No luck. I went home and checked the Breyers website to find out what other stores might be carrying it. According to the website, my local grocery was supposed to carry it! I went back the next day, and found it placed on the bottom self in the ice cream section for brands that are strictly non-dairy.
I checked out the carton, and was delighted to see the short list of ingredients. While the use of almond milk is prominently placed on the cartoon, the use of coconut for flavor is not. It's something to be aware of, if considering allergies. The carton also claims responsibly sourced ingredients. The only drawback is that corn syrup is still being used.
My kids and I tried it right after dinner. We LOVED it. It was easy to scoop. The texture is creamy just like dairy ice cream, not grainy like other non-dairy desserts I've tried. My son and I agreed that it tasted slightly like marshmallows. I don't like marshmallows, so when I say it had that taste it was a very light, mellow, pleasant flavor. The peanut butter swirls were distinctly real peanut butter. The vanilla and peanut butter were a perfect combination on a hot evening. Another plus is that I didn't feel full and bloated after enjoying this ice cream! I typically do after having dairy ice cream.
This was so good that the three of us finished an entire carton in one sitting. I can't wait to try the Cookies and Cream flavor next!"

However its higher than other ice creams and honestly above my budget but I got some extra cash and decides to indulge a bit. The raspberry sauce is surprisingly delicious. I thought it would be good but it is better than expected. I was expecting cheese cake pieces but instead it has cheesecake flavored ice-cream that taste nothing like cheesecake. I enjoy actual bites of cheesecake in my ice-cream. I enjoy the texture of the bites with ice-cream. I really don't care for the ice- cream, personally I think it would be better with vanilla ice cream and cheesecake pieces. The Graham cracker crumbs taste good. In all I gave it a three because of the lack of cheese cake pieces and flavor. Other than that the ice-cream actually taste like ice cream. I wouldn't have none it was gelato. The taste and texture are the same as ice-cream even though the flavor isn't my favorite. I will not be buying it again but look forward to trying other flavors like the salted caramel one."

In this day & age you have to be careful if there is no seal from a safety standpoint I would not buy this product for that reason alone
27_breyers,Logan11111,2018-10-03,4,Needs more crumbs.,1,0,While I love the Raspberry cheesecake it is the best bite while with the crumbs. With that being said it needs to have some within so you get it in every bite!
27_breyers,GrannyMac,2020-05-26,5,The Best Ever!!!!,0,0,"This product is the BOMB!!! Absolutely the smoothest, creamiest ice cream type product ever. Gelato is so so fabulous! This cheesecake flavor is so Delicious even by itself...but when you add in that silky raspberry sauce it takes it to a whole new level. Oh, and those little bursts of sugary graham cracker sprinkles? OMG...If you don't try this Breyers Raspberry Cheesecake Gelato...you are missing out on a product I rate a 12 out of a possible 10. Yes, it's that great."
27_breyers,saseymom,2019-02-11,5,Yummy Goodness!!,0,0,I absolutely love the Breyers Raspberry Cheesecake Gelato Indulgences! So much so I keep the freezer stocked and have some every day. My local grocer makes sure to keep plenty on hand. I don't care for vanilla so I was really happy to find the geloto is cheesecake flavor. The raspberry sauce is so yummy and the graham topping adds a perfect final touch. It's very different from ice cream as it is much more creamy and smooth. It's yumminess at its best.
27_breyers,Smittyinnola,2020-09-05,1,I never thought I would use the word disappointed,0,1,It’s supposed to be raspberry cheesecake ice cream. Raspberry cheesecake! One of the best combos in the word. Yikes! This gelato was so disappointing. I might throw the rest off the carton away. There is no cheesecake taste to the ice cream. The raspberry is like a bitter jello. Overall you get this cold unflavorful sweet taste. The most disappointing ice cream I have ever had. ☹️
27_breyers,tc82,2018-06-05,4,A tasty dessert,0,0,"I got this for my boyfriend who loves all things cheesecake. He really enjoyed the raspberry swirls but felt that the vanilla gelato bit needed to be less sweet and have more texture. His exact phrasing was that it ""needs to be more cheesecakey."" Still, he ate half the container in on sitting so he clearly enjoyed it a lot! I received this product free for testing purposes."
27_breyers,sunshine,2017-08-31,5,Best ever,1,1,I think your (none) ice cream is the best ever. It's more creamy then ice cream! I sure did switch to yours. No more Hershey. Boring. Yours is number 1.

I tried searching through the entire carton and found around 10 small Reese’s cup pieces. At that point you shouldn’t even be able to call it Reese’s ice cream. It’s just peanut butter ice cream. I mean they aren’t lying on their packaging though, when they say 35% more peanut butter cups. 35x0 is still 0...."
28_breyers,Ericka,2020-10-03,1,No Reece’s in ice cream,0,0,I am very disappointed in this ice cream as I love Reece’s !!! The advertising really sells this ice cream to have real Reece’s in it .. I dug and dug and dug and found 0!!! I am very dissatisfied as this ice cream taste nothing like Reece’s due to their being no Reece’s in it ! It just taste like chocolate ice cream .
28_breyers,ellkay,2018-09-27,2,Disappointed :(,14,1,"My favorite ice cream flavor is anything with peanut butter cups! I thought I would try this one, and what a disappointment it was. I don't know what the base is. It's not chocolate. It's not vanilla, and it's not peanut butter (or at least, doesn't taste like any of them). I don't know WHAT it is! But it tasted ""okay"". Then I began to indulge. At the beginning of the ice cream, you get some chunks of what I think are chocolate pieces, and maybe some small pieces of peanut butter cups. But it seems to be a bit skimpy. So about half way through, I decided to melt it down so I can see just how much ""blast"" is actually in it. And I found NONE! I found not ONE SINGLE peanut butter cup or chocolate chunk! NADA! So in addition to a ""weird"" ice cream base, it is very skimpy on the ""blast"" part. It would be so much better with a vanilla base ice cream, and MORE PBC's!!!
Since I was so disappointed in it, I won't be buying it again.
And by the way, why the heck do you need to know how old I am, what my gender is, etc? Stop asking personal questions! Or at the very least, make those ""optional"" questions.

28_breyers,Vince,2019-02-13,2,Missing something...,3,1,I was expecting more after seeing 35% more Reeses pieces. Instead I received 100% less!

This time was completely different. I wish I was exaggerating when I say there were NO reese's peanut butter cup pieces. None whatsoever. I kept digging and digging around and nothing! Super disappointed, especially since the packaging claims there is ""35% more peanut butter cup pieces."" That's definitely false and super misleading. There were gobs of chocolate sauce which over powered the peanut butter flavor of ice cream.
Probably not getting this flavor again."

I was expecting the ice cream to taste like the peanut butter of an actual resee's cup but definitely did not. As a matter of fact, no taste of peanut butter. What a disappointment and will never waste my money on this product. Breyers, to me, this is false advertisement. After reading the reviews, it seems as tho most people feel the same. What a shame!"

Ice cream is blandly flavored with the odd tiny piece of chocolate, and streaks of some sort of fudge flavoring that I can't even call fudge, because that would be ok tasting.

Usually I find it in Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and any other supermarkets or frozen food shops. I love all the ben & Jerry's ice cream but this flavour deffinetly has to be my favourite one."

28_breyers,Anonymous,2019-06-16,5,,0,0,I just tried this stuff the other day! Wow! The ice cream is wonderful. But... The gigantic pieces of reeses peanut butter cup are GREAT! I had no idea the pieces of candy would be so big! I will definitely be getting this again. It was on the higher price of what I like to spend on ice cream. But I was able to get it half off on a sale at Kroger. So watch out for sales to get this wonderful icecream half off. Definitely try it! The giant pieces of candy are wonderful.
28_breyers,originalbreyersfan,2019-03-23,1,"Corn syrup, sticky goo, tan coloring and skim milk",2,0,"I was *so* looking forward to this special treat after seeing one of my old favorite ice creams from long ago now had peanut butter cup flavor. Unfortunately, not only did this not live up to expectations, it was rather awful-- sickeningly sweet, to the point of leaving an aftertaste, and not at all creamy-- rather water in fact. I checked the box and it became obvious why-- the ingredients are mainly milk and corn syrup and various gums now. The only cream is way down at the end of the list after a dozen different versions of sugar and corn syrup. And it's not even called ice cream anymore-- it's a ""frozen dairy dessert"". There weren't any sizeable chunks of peanut butter cups to make eating the marshmallow-like base at all enjoyable either. I don't eat ice cream very often anymore, but when I do I'm going to think twice before picking Breyers after this experience. At the very least, I'll need to read the box carefully from now on-- something I didn't have to worry about with Breyers many years ago."
28_breyers,AaronH,2019-01-21,1,Soylent dessert.,2,0,"This cured me of my weakness for ice cream, sorry, frozen dairy dessert. Tastes like peanut butter flavored marshmallow. Frozen Cool Whip is closer to ice cream than this. Food science has failed us all and Reese's, you've made a huge mistake putting your name on this."
28_breyers,bm23,2020-01-14,1,Bland,2,0,I was so excited to try this! Who doesn’t love Reese’s? The ice cream itself was very bland and barely had any peanut flavor. There was barely any Reese’s cups in the entire carton and the “fudge swirl” was very underwhelming. Will not buy again.
28_breyers,Trav Dial,2018-11-04,5,#1 CUSTOMER BEST ICE CREAM EVER,1,0,This Ice Cream is AMAZING. My brother and I eat a container in one serving half for him and half for me.We go trlhrough at least 2 containers a day except when we buy the stores out of stock. I'm truly addicted to this product. It is loaded with chunks of Reese's and the ice cream is peanut butter flavored. It's the best ice cream ever made and we will be lifetime customers. Keep up the good work BREYERS WE ARE YOUR #1 CUSTOMERS.
28_breyers,Koepka16,2020-06-15,2,Where’s the Reese’s?,2,0,Was so excited for this ice cream and was super bummed out when I only had a few Reese’s mixed in the whole carton. The fudge swirl helped with the flavor but I was missing the star of dessert.
28_breyers,brandnova,2019-07-10,2,,0,0,"bought this as they didn't have any usually peanut butter cup ice cream at the store and was thoroughly disappointed. the taste of the Ice cream alone needs a lot of work. hardly any peanut butter cup pieces ( and they're chopped up pieces not entire mini cups) . was hoping it would be better but was upset at the outcome.
however if you can get past the initial taste it is a very affordable ice cream."

The price is about average compared to others but the make flavors like Reeses, snickers and other candy flavors I love and the ice cream isnt so solid when you push your spoon in it that it bends the spoon, very smooth and good but also has a fair amount of chunky candy pieces that I love."

28_breyers,Charlie007,2020-06-11,2,Very marginal,0,0,"I had to double check if this is sugar free, so it isn’t too sweet. That’s perhaps a plus, but it ends there. I typically buy b&j peanut butter cup, which is incredibly delicious and indulgent. And expensive. So I thought I’d give a lower calorie choice a try. There is very little Reese’s in the ice cream.
I also ate briars growing up and well into adulthood, but changed brands at some point. Now I know why! It is inexpensive and tastes like diet ice cream, nothing offensive. I had to do a quick search to see if others didn’t enjoy it, and to see if it was low sugar. Maybe they forgot sugar in this run or something. I have to say, I was very surprised and underwhelmed. I don’t see how this got out of the test kitchen. But I guess all the positive reviews tell the story. To each their own."

What used to be the very best ice cream ever in history has now become a simple chocolate peanut “flavored” ice cream. Boo that. I’ll not waste anymore of my money on what used to be my fave. I’m so bummed."

There isn’t any distinctive or real flavor and it’s MAJORLY blandish colored ice cream. I couldn’t believe it and unfortunately I do not plan on buying this ever again.

Half chocolate and half peanut butter ice cream with my 2 favorite peanut butter candies. Upon opening, I noticed that the chocolate ice cream was missing. After some digging, I was able to find a sliver of chocolate. Very sad to say there was no increase in the chocolate ice cream as I got to the bottom. Also the peanut butter ice cream tasted like it was watered down. Disappointing. I will not buy this again."
29_breyers,Josie,2019-08-19,1,Nope! First time ive been disappointed w Breyers,7,1,"I was six excited because I love chocolate and peanut butter. And I LOVE Reese’s Pieces. But you know when you make the mistake of buying baking candies, & they’re so tiny that the filling is barely there and the shell doesn’t taste the same?!?! I wish they would’ve just crunched up actual Reese’s pieces and cups and added them to regular chocolate ice cream & peanut butter swirl ice cream. The chocolate ice cream had so little flavor, it tasted watered down. That was a first. Usually it’s creamy & rich. Nope, it almost tasted like a knock off version of chocolate ice cream. So sad!"

It barely has any chocolate ice cream or hardly any mini Reese's pieces. It did have a bit of peanut butter cup pieces but it was just more of a Reese's ice cream instead of 2 and one. And more peanut butter taste and barely any chocolate."

First thing I noticed when I opened it up was the big chunks of Reese's peanut butter cups. There were a lot of reese's pieces as well. The ice cream itself was a perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter flavors. They were separated enough where I could eat each flavor somewhat separately or spoon them together for that chocolate with peant butter taste. It was great. The big chunks of Reeses with the pieces was an awesome addition. I felt like a kid, picking them out. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. As a chocolate and peanut butter fan, I will definitely be getting this again."

Then I open it up expecting to see chunks of deliciousness, but nothing. Maybe the chunks were just deeper in... so I dug... and dug... and dug. Nope, no chunks. I scooped up a big bowl hoping at least to enjoy delicious chocolate and peanut buttery ice cream, but the flavors were a little muted and watery. I saw other reviews with pictures of delicious chunks and others seemed to think it tasted good. I want to try it again, but I don’t want to waste money on another flop :("

Then I opened the container and made myself a bowl. The chocolate was bland, unlike the other Breyers chocolate and the peanut butter almost had no flavor. The Reese’s pieces were hard and for lack of a better word, stale. I think the most disappointing part is that in my entire container, I couldn’t find a single peanut butter cup. Now I am an ice cream lover and I hate to say, I ate two bowls of this trying to love it, and wound up throwing the rest away. It’s a great idea, just done really poorly."
29_breyers,Chel,2019-08-19,1,When your dreams are let downs.,0,0,"I can’t find a single Reese’s cup, and there’s maybe 10 Reese’s pieces... talk about depressing. I thought maybe I got a bad batch so I checked the reviews to see & I guess I wasn’t the only one"
29_breyers,Sms26,2018-06-10,4,Great combo,0,0,"I was able to try this complimentary of influenster for my review. I was immediately drawn to this combo, as these are flavors I might seek separately in other ice creams, and I thought it would be jam packed with flavor. The ice cream itself is nice and creamy. It is not, however, overly sweet ice cream by itself. The chunks of reeses cups were large and delicious when you were able to find them. There were not as many pieces of Reese's pieces or cups as I thought there would be in this combo. I expected that a product advertising the Reese's would have a satisfactory reeses flavor, but it was mostly just ice cream with an occasionally flavor boost. Regardless, the product was good and was easily finished in my house!!"
29_breyers,MommaC,2019-08-19,1,Very disappointed,0,0,No Reese's cups Maybe a dozen reese's pieces in the whole tub. Kids were very excited a huge disappointment.

29_breyers,Icecreamgirl,2019-08-19,1,Not as described!,2,0,What a disappointment! I bought this expecting it to be as described - my container was all peanut butter ice cream. No peanut butter cups in the ice cream either! The chocolate ice cream with the Reese’s pieces was also missing :-(
29_breyers,AlexG,2018-06-04,4,Yummy chocolate mix,0,0,"When I saw Breyers had new 2in1 flavors, I thought it was a fun & unique idea. You get the best of both worlds or in this case 2 scoops you get to choose from. The Snickers & M&M Pieces mix is really good especially if you love chocolate. I get bits of Snickers shell along with crunchy M&M pieces. I like the real ice cream flavor made from quality ingredients, it just makes it so much better. This satisfies both my ice cream & candy bar flavor in one serving. Yummy. I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review."
29_breyers,Pooseekat,2019-02-16,3,Great Concept,0,0,"The fact that this had peanut butter ice cream as well as chocolate was perfect on its own. But then throw in pb cups AND Reese’s pieces? Amazing.
I loved it. Almost all of it. The only disappointment was the fact that the Reese’s pieces tasted like they were made completely of wax. I ended up spitting out the pieces and trying to scoop around them.
I love Breyer’s I’ve Cream and will continue to buy it but I won’t be purchasing this particular combination anymore because of the waxy taste and texture."
29_breyers,Jesskarabbit,2018-04-08,3,2 in 1 but definitely not half &half,1,0,More pb&Reese cup than chocolate and reeses pieces. This is my 2nd container and only seems to be getting worse! Taste good but should of been equal parts. Now I'm out of the reeses pieces.

I few minutes later my wife says "" why can't someone make a peanut butter ice cream that taste like peanut butter?"" I said that I agreed. Not only did it not really taste like peanut butter it had a strange syrupy taste. Tastes fake all around. Not much filling and wasn't creamy. It was bad enough to provoke me to leave a review..."
29_breyers,Asiavakoc,2018-07-09,2,My favorite flavors,0,0,"Yummy! But there was almost no chocolate in our tub. Chocolate is my favorite so i was hoping ours would have a lot more chocolate in it. Although I did like the peanut butter ice cream with the cups in it there weren't very many. I always think it's a good idea to put m&ms or Reece's pieces in ice cream and it's just never good they're much too hard on the teeth. still I love almost all ice cream sonit was still yummy!

All that ice cream has been Ben and Jerry's. Idk why i decided to change it up but i did and I grabbed this flavor. and holy blandness batman! You barely cant taste anything, only when i get a goot bite that has a big reeeses cup in there could i taste anything. This is a 10/10 never buying again, not jsut this, any Breyers bc I dont want to get more blandness."
29_breyers,ME60,2018-08-03,2,High Expectations/ Low Results,0,0,"Love Reese's Pieces. Thought this sounded like a great combo. But mostly tasted the chocolate ice cream, not nearly enough of the Reeses or the peanut butter (Peanut butter and chocolate is a killer combo) and also, it was a bit too sweet. I had a couple of scoops with another ice cream - and found myself enjoying the other far more. This won't stop me from trying another one of your 2in1 combos, but it will stop me from buying this particular pairing again."

The ice cream was light and smooth and the amount of candy within the ice cream was a perfect proportion. This ice cream would be perfect on any occasion. Only downside, there was an end to the bucket
I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to try this product via a coupon from Influenster. Thank you for this great chance!"
29_breyers,JennOvey,2018-06-19,5,Delicious!,0,0,"Peanut butter anything is a huge win in our house with Reese's topping the list of favorite candies. This 2 in 1 was an instant favorite, the consistent delicious flavor of Breyers icecream paired with two different types of Reese's with the crunch of the pieces and the smoothness of the cup pieces was to die for. The price is always right as well. While I received this product free for testing, I would purchase it again and again."

When they tired it , they were happy enough, I mean what kid complains about icecream lol.
But for me it was a miss. It had a grainy texture and the peanut butter icecream didnt hit that flavor. Also there wasnt a lot of the pieces or cups in neither the chocolate or the PB.

Everyone in my family was so excited to try this flavor and it did not disappoint! My children loved the chunks of Reeses and the Reeses pieces in their icecream.

With every single bite you are getting either a peanut butter cup, or some of the pieces-and sometimes both! It is a most wonderful combination and the appearance before you even eat it is wonderful.

I would’ve liked the chocolate ice cream to have a stronger chocolate flavor. It just didn’t hold its own against all the peanut butter. But overall, it was delicious.

Oh my goodness it is absolutely amazing. We bought the Reese's & Reese's Pieces and my kids and I instantly fell in love! The flavors are go good together and the ice cream just tastes subperb. We will definetly be trying all of the other flavors and cannot wait!
29_breyers,Teal,2018-07-04,2,Product not as described,0,0,"Not a single peanut butter cup in the whole container. Ice cream flavor was fine but not great, I agree with others that it could use more peanut butter and chocolate flavor. If the description says it has PB cups, include PB cups.

There is a perfect mix of peanut butter ice cream as well as chocolate. My suggestion would be to increase the mixed in candies as there weren't many in a few scoops.

29_breyers,CassandraL,2018-04-22,2,"Amazing Idea, But Product Needs Work",0,0,"The peanut butter ice cream is alright, but not great. The chocolate ice cream doesn't have enough flavour. I think the chocolate should have a peanut butter swirl in it and the peanut butter should have a chocolate or fudge swirl.
I'd rather they were side by side 50/50 (like Neapolitan) so that I could scoop equal amounts of each or whatever ratio I want. My mix wasn't close to even.
The Reese's pieces really need to be regular sized, NOT minis. They're so small that it's basically no flavour, only texture, which in in cream is just hard cold bits anyway....without flavour they serve no purpose.
There's not enough candy in my carton either. I had a really large bowl instead of dinner. There were two small bites of Reese's cups and I think 5 of the mini Reese's pieces in the entire bowl.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the idea of this. I just wish it was better executed. Peanut Butter and Chocolate are my favourite ice cream flavours. Reese's cups and Reese's pieces are my favourite candy. There's so much hope for this product. Plllllease pretty please make improvements. Don't axe it. =(
If I had another suggestion it would be chocolate ice cream with pb cookie dough and the other half PB ice cream with regular cookie dough"

30_breyers,blessed27,2020-02-26,5,This is the best ice cream,1,0,"I have tried a lot of no sugar, low calorie items and this stuff is amazing. I would take it over the regular stuff. I highly recommend. It’s even good to give to kids so cut back on the sugar."
30_breyers,Randylip,2019-02-24,5,Best Icer cream I ever had,1,0,"The Brewers Salted Caramel is the best ice cream I ever had.
Smooth, creamy, not too sweet and supposedly not as bad for you as regular ice cream, with sugars and calories."
30_breyers,flylizfly,2020-09-21,4,,0,0,"I deducted one star because it kind of fell short of what I was wanting. It’s not bad it’s just very basic it’s vanilla ice cream with a swirl of caramel. It’s better than just a basic vanilla if you’re not eating sugar and want a little pizzazz and there’s nothing else available, it gets the job done. It’s pretty affordable especially for the price of some of the healthier options this is a great product if you’re avoiding sugar but able to handle dairy.￼"
30_breyers,gracerc2c0,2020-09-22,5,,0,0,I’ll be honest...I didn’t have very high expectations for a sugar free ice cream. I love caramel so I was sure I would be at least slightly disappointed by the flavor. Boy was I wrong!! This ice cream knocked it out of the park! The caramel swirl with crunchy bits of salt are to die for! I have recommended this to so many people already and would buy it over regular ice cream in a heartbeat!

But as my cravings kicked in tonight I ventured off to the local and nearest smiths drug store to pick up some of this great stuff.....

I’m going along tasting wonderful notes of vanilla and caramel awaiting the crunch of the that great candy and what happens next NO snickers ! In the 10% more container not one bit of snickers candy...this was a weird tub!
31_breyers,skydiver620,2020-03-08,1,Where are the Snickers?,4,0,The reviews that give this product 5 stars appear to be fake. The snickers pieces are so finely blended you don't really taste anything other than vanilla ice cream. It's a shame. If you want snickers just eat a snickers.

I was so dumb founded that I went searching on the internet to see if what I ate was real or a figment is my imagination, do not buy this product. It’s absolute trash. I second the motion of the other guys comment that Mars candy needs to revoke their name from this product."

32_breyers,TrishaK,2018-05-30,5,Delicious!!!,3,1,I received this complimentary to review. I am currently eating this ice cream while I review it. I have been addicted to ice cream for like the past month to where I eat some almost every day! And this ice cream is delicious. I normally do not like crunchy things in it except for peanuts. I was hoping the peanut chunks were bigger like in a snickers bar. And I am not minding the crunchiness of the m&m’s. This was a perfect choice at the store because I wanted snickers and my son wanted a different flavor and we finally came together and decided on this. I recommend trying this if you haven’t yet.
32_breyers,Kimmer,2018-06-08,5,So rich and creamy,2,1,My daughter absolutely went bonkers over this flavor. She kept saying she could really taste the snickers and mnm's. I received this product free from @influenster as a trial but we will definitely be purchasing more in the future. Can't wait to check out other flavors.
32_breyers,Disappointed family,2019-01-15,1,Totally Terrible!,3,0,"The outside of the box makes it appear to have a strip of snickers in the middle with chocolate M&M on each side. Our box was 3/4 snickers and a very small 1/4 slice of chocolate M&M on one side! So small, we can barely see any chocolate!This ice cream is awful! Breyer’s ruined a great thing by getting rid of the chocolate M&M. Such a disappointment & will not purchase again!"
32_breyers,Kato,2018-06-04,4,Pretty Good!,1,0,"I received a complimentary coupon from influenster for testing purposes. I love things with nuts and so I jumped at the chance to try the Snickers/M&M 2 in 1 from Breyers. I tried it and the reason it gets a 4 star is only because I'm not fond of the chocolate ice cream and M&M part... it's ok I guess, not for me. The snickers part is delicious and I wish the whole ice cream tub was of snickers and caramel only. The pieces of snickers are amazing. I would definitely buy Breyers but not this 2 in 1... maybe one with just snickers."
32_breyers,Anonymous,2019-09-03,5,Excellent ice cream,1,1,"This ice cream is amazing. Creamy vanilla formula. Has huge chunks of snickers candy bars and peanuts on one side. On the other it is packed full of m&m with a chocolate swirl. One of the best ice creams I’ve ever tried in my entire life. Full of candy, full of creaminess and taste so amazing. My family tears 2 of these up a week if not more. It was super amazing that Influenster sent me a coupon for a free one when we already purchased this ice cream on a regular basis already. It was like adding the cherry on top. My family of 4 absolutely loves this ice cream. Nothing to complain about! Keep doing y’all thing!! #gotitfree"

The ice cream itself was creamy and delicious, and there was a perfect amount of candy in each scoop, you didn't have to go digging around in the carton just to find the candy. Will definitely be trying the other flavors in this line! *I received this product free for testing.*"
32_breyers,Anonymous970228,2019-05-27,2,Only Snickers,0,0,"This ice cream is great if you only want snickers ice cream. The first one I bought there was just a little strip of m&m ice cream, but it was still pretty good. I bought it again thinking maybe it was just that one that was like that. The one I just bought is literally just snickers ice cream, there's no sign of chocolate or m&ms in it at all. Very displeased with it."
32_breyers,Lhudson,2018-06-12,4,Yummy,0,0,This ice cream is absolutely delicious. Snickers and m&ms are my favorite candies. The recipe uses mini m&ms. I either wished the company used full size candies or had more of them. The m&m side of the container uses chocolate I cream while the snickers side has vanilla. Full disclosure: I received this product free for testing.
32_breyers,teletabby20,2018-07-10,4,Definitely Different,0,0,"The 2in1 Snickers and M&M's is different to say the least. It is good but I would prefer vanilla ice cream with swirls of caramel, peanuts like in a snickers does, and then mini m&m's would be better than it is now, in my opinion at least.
I received this product from Influenster for free for my honest opinion."
32_breyers,SA91,2018-09-14,1,Not 50/50,3,0,I also got almost all snicker and no mini m and ms messed up :/. If you can make a mini m and ms ice cream all by itself please I would buy that.

32_breyers,Danielle France7,2018-06-19,5,Jam packed delight,0,0,"What's better then ice cream? A jam packed flavor explosion of your favorite candies in a creamy chocolate / vanilla mix of ice cream. As we know the summer heat I'd pumping up, I made these delicious treats for my nephews and son to cool off to on a hot summer night. This ice cream is so delicious. Every bite is packed with delicious snicker and m&m bites. The vanilla contains snickers pieces and the Chocolate portion is m&m candies. This will definitely be a staple in our house all summer long. I was able to get this complementary carton from influenster to try."
32_breyers,Car Car,2018-09-04,1,Not for me.,2,0,Unless your a chocolate lover this ice cream isn't for you well then again I can only write for myself and honestly the ice cream wasn't for me ( chocolate took control) and it is still in the deep freezer.
32_breyers,Jackie095,2018-03-29,4,Really good,2,0,Love this ice cream. The only thing that would make it better would be more mini M&Ms.
32_breyers,Irishblend,2018-09-19,3,Taste yummy... but,1,0,I enjoyed this ice cream a lot. Both flavors were delicious! But the container I bought was almost all snickers ice cream. I'd say it was about 1/4 the m&m's chocolate ice cream. I'd recommend this ice cream but it would be a shame if it happened to that person too.
32_breyers,Soniacrespo431,2018-06-08,3,Not enough mini m&ms,1,0,I didnt really enjoy the flavor. The caramel was too overpowering and it didnt taste enough like chocolate. Also we found a total of about 10 mini m&ms. Thats not nearly enough! I wouldnt buy this flavor again. But i would try the other flavors.

32_breyers,Dochie,2018-10-11,5,Loved both flavors,1,0,This ice cream is so yummy. Love both flavors equally so it is quite a tasty treat
32_breyers,Monimoflavor,2019-10-04,2,Why both?,0,0,I love the idea of chocolate ice cream with m&m mini's. But snickers?!? Why do I have to taste peanut when all i want is a chocolate overload. To make it worse is its 85% snickers icecream. I stand a better chance at buying chocolate ice cream and picking up the mini's to pour on top leaving out the wanted effects of super cold mini's in every bite of the icecream. Combining the flavors was a bad idea... sell them separately but sell them both.
32_breyers,Midnightpraise,2018-05-12,1,M & M ice cream is ruined,1,1,Snickers mixed with M & M ice cream is terrible. Breyers ruined the M & M ice cream by mixing it. Bring back just the original M & M ice cream because all that is available in stores is the terrible mixed ice cream

But this was an opportunity to show them just what they are missing out on. Snickers and nuts on one side m&m and chocolate swirl on the other. Simply amazing. It was incredibly delicious. Thanks influenster for the free offer.. you never fail to amaze me."

I buy a new flavor every weekend. This was a huge disappointment."

32_breyers,Wanda,2020-09-29,5,Simply Delicious,0,0,Here it is 2020 and I am just finding out about this ice cream. It is simply delicious. I can't get enough. I ate 3 scoops and went back for 3 more. I just wish the snickers and the m&m minis were equal in portion in the 2 in 1. I am now hooked on this flavor
32_breyers,emilyskees30,2018-06-08,5,Ice Cream/Candy perfection,0,0,I love candy and I love ice cream. Now you don't have to choose between them. Have them both. Breyers made perfect combo when making the 2 in 1 ice cream. It is so rich in flavor and BOLD in taste. It It is perfectly combined and makes myouth water with every bite. It is perfection in a little carton.
32_breyers,KRLaw,2018-06-12,4,Kid Friendly,0,0,My kiddos loved this ice cream! I would have loved bigger chunks of Snickers mixed in.

33_breyers,Cheri,2020-01-21,1,Changes in Packaging,20,2,The bars are good but the carb content is now more than it was previously. As part of a low carb diet I would consume these as a treat. The packaging is very deceiving to those who bought them in the past. I bought some thinking it had 6 net carbs and realized it said 6 sugars. Which is way too many carbs. Equals out to be 9 or more per bar depending on which variety you get. I have switched to a different brand that offers lower net carbs. Was disheartened to see the way the packaging was so misleading. :(
33_breyers,Ing2You,2018-12-03,2,"Tasty, BUT...too many net carbs!!",48,5,"I have so looked forward to Breyers CarbSmart ice cream bars in the past. They were/are such a treat when watching net carbs, but now the net carbs of this Almond Bar (and their others as well) are greater than 8 carbs. Just way TOO MANY. Unfortunately, I will rarely be purchasing them after this.
***Please lower the net carb content. They are NO LONGER ""CarbSmart."""

Please change back to original product. I used to buy it all the time and loved it. I really will miss it but will no longer purchase. Too many concentrated carbs! Why?

He does have a chemical taste now that I can not get past now. I have never written a review before on a item but this was my favorite at one time PLEASE GO BACK TO OLD ONE !!!
33_breyers,Angie,2019-04-28,5,Yummy,3,0,A very good low carb treat/dessert. Has a very good flavor!
33_breyers,Ncgirl2004,2020-01-10,1,I hate the new recipe,2,0,"I loved these bars before the recent change in the recipe. It tasted as good as the high carb ice cream bars. Now, the ice cream tastes “watered down”...the rich, creamy flavor is gone. I won’t be purchasing anymore unless the old recipe is brought back."
33_breyers,TDog,2019-11-16,5,Soooooooo good,2,0,"I just purchased the Almond Bars today and I was pretty excited. I usually stroll in the ice cream section for my kids and husband. I’ve been on Keto for almost a month (lost almost 15 pounds) and I always look for a low carb sweet treat. Other brands of low carb or high protein ice cream have too many carbs. And low carb desserts/bars have a weird aftertaste of what ever sweetener is being used. I’ve pretty much gone without a sweet treat, but since I’m a woman and am craving chocolate this week, I gave in. It was the best purchase today at the grocery store. It was the right portion, perfect sweetness and perfect amount of chocolate and almonds. If it had more almonds people, the carb count would go up! I can’t believe some of you think it has too many carbs. Go look at a regular ice cream bar with almonds. I’m sure it will shock you! I will definitely save my carbs for a special treat once or twice during the week. Having my almond cream cream bar tonight satisfied something that I guess was missing. Yeah, the meat and cheese can get old!!!"
33_breyers,Nickandre,2018-10-19,5,A little too good...,1,0,I’m a huge fan of these because the artificial sweetener taste is not very obvious and they are still made with real cream instead of some skim milk disaster that most of the other low carb bars are. The only snafu is that if you end up eating half a box of these you’ll still end up with a lot of carbs but one is pretty reasonable for dessert.
33_breyers,marieg,2020-06-28,5,Excellent,1,0,What a yummy treat. It is 5g of net carbs. Not 8 like some have stated. I don’t feel like this is a ridiculous amount as an occasional treat. The taste was excellent and very satisfying. Way better than I expected and didn’t really taste low carb. Would definitely buy again. Highly recommended.
33_breyers,Swiftor,2020-05-09,5,Surprisingly good!,1,0,I had gotten used to weird substitutes for ice creams and treats while on Keto - but this one - I sort of can't believe its only 5 net carbs. Tastes close to what I remember a normal chocolate covered bar tasting like. Definitely enough for me to toss this into the rotation as a regular treat.
33_breyers,Valeriemj,2020-01-21,5,Just amazing!!!,1,0,"I tried these bars for the first time last week and they are exactly what I need to give myself a keto friendly treat! I went back for more and they were totally sold out at my neighborhood store. They’re so amazing, get them while you can!"
33_breyers,Albert,2018-08-05,1,No almond in the Almond bars,1,0,I bought 2 boxes of Carb Smart Almond bars and all 12 contents didn't have a single almond. It looks like just a vanilla bar dipped in chocolate. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
33_breyers,LariDee,2018-01-29,5,Close to the REAL THING,1,0,pretty delicious and has real chocolate cover ice cream flavor. So good I had to eat two! I will be buying it again. Recommend to others!
33_breyers,Crazythat,2018-05-28,5,OMG these bars though!!,0,0,"These bars are so creamy and rich with a delicate, delicious crunchy almond/chocolate outer shell. My husband and I are type1 diabetics and these taste so indulgent for not too many carbs. They are a ""treat"" but absolutely worth an occasional exchange for a piece of fruit. In fact, these are so yummy, we must hide them from my 16yo daughter and her friends because it's the first thing they look for when they come visiting, lol!"
33_breyers,traceyqd,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"I have been doing low carb for several years and one thing I miss the most is ice cream. Although halo top is allowed, I find it to taste somewhat chalky and sometimes oily. These bars are perfect, hit the spot, and fill my need for cold goodness. Unfortunately, they are so good, I eat way too many of them! Wish they would come up with a few more flavors though."
33_breyers,Xraybob,2017-09-13,5,A dairy delight for diabetics,1,2,"Add more almonds, too many bars have been deprived of their potential to achieve their full potential. A thicker coating of chocolate would be great too. I'd even be willing to pay slightly more."
33_breyers,alisonhenryhouston,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"Of course it doesn't taste exactly like a regular ice cream bar, but it's a good substitute. Refreshing and sweet, and it was exactly what I needed on day 4 of my keto diet. I just ate one a few minutes ago, so it's too early to say if it will upset my stomach or anything. It does have 3 grams of sugar alcohol in each one."
33_breyers,wanton2know,2018-07-07,5,Totally On Point,0,0,I keep seeing people complain about the amount of net carbs in this low carb treat and all I have to say is in my opinion you get tons of bang for your buck with these babies. They are excellent! Just as good as any other regular ice cream bar and I love the almonds in the chocolate. Thank you Bryers.
33_breyers,Ariah,2020-09-15,5,Best ever for keto lifestyle.,0,0,"I love these bars. To the person below, net carbs are 5. 10 - 3 fiber - 3 sugar alcohol = 5 net carbs. They do not taste like a ""diet"" bar in any way. My store ran out or discontinued them, so I'm very disappointed now."

34_breyers,LittleMissPretty,2018-06-17,4,Yummy Sweet Treat!,1,0,"Love Heath Bar! So I went with the Waffle Cone Heath Bar 2 in 1. Over all, the whole family was very pleased. The ice cream has a rich texture that cradles the candy pieces and it didn't separate from the candy like some brands. Great flavor combination, but I would have liked to see bigger chunks of Heath Bar. Other than that it was awesome! And it was free for my honest reveiw and testing.I would recommend you give it a try!"
34_breyers,Hannah G,2020-02-13,2,2 in 1?,0,0,"Heath and waffle cone! What could go wrong? Well, after digging through my carton of ice cream, it looks like it can go about 50% wrong. It’s all chocolate! If it were advertised as being just chocolate heath it would be fine, but I was really looking forward to some vanilla waffle cone yumminess. Better luck next time I guess?"
34_breyers,MLG3,2018-06-11,1,Who Approved This?,9,1,"I have been a fan of Breyers since it was truly natural. Since I love Heath bar, I assumed it would good. In a word: AWFUL! It tastes like watered down Neapolitan without the strawberry with occasional unidentifiable brown crunchy things. I could not taste Heath bar at all. I threw it out."
34_breyers,Prinzessambular,2018-06-01,4,Waffle Pcs Are Yummy!!,1,1,I thought this ice cream taste good!! The chocolate covered waffle cone pieces were delicious!! I felt that it could have used more Heath Bar flavor and pieces in it. I did not seem to taste much of that flavor. It was still good ice cream. I love this brand. I received a coupon to try this product free for my review.
34_breyers,BCME,2018-06-14,1,Disappointing,10,2,"I have been a Breyers fan my whole life. In general I definitely prefer the ice creams over the frozen dairy desserts. After my sister's recommendation I found I loved the wafflecone but wished it was chocolate based. Since I like heathbars, and the wafflecone was in chocolate for the 2 in 1, I was very excited to try this product.
Unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing!!!
1.) The bits in the heath section were few and far between, and only about 10% of those bits had toffee... it was mostly just chocolate bits. It would have been a million times better for the heath to have been in a natural vanilla or vanilla bean base to help bring out the little toffee flavor there was.
2.) While I loved the wafflecone cone with the chocolate, the ratio in the container was about 85% vanilla heath to 15% chocolate wafflecone. I understand getting a 50/50 mix is probably too much to hope for, but it would have been nice if it was at least close.
Bottom line.... There's not much worse than wasting calories on mediocre ice cream. If I had wanted a carton of vanilla, I would have bought natural vanilla instead."
34_breyers,rs22,2018-08-31,1,this sounded good... but wait!,1,0,"this sounded good. NOT. Foamy and slimy. What ARE you doing to it and who would think this is good? It SHOULD be. But it isn't. I am depending on Blue Bell vanilla bean these days. It tastes like a better version or Breyers old original vanilla bean flavor when it was made with just milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla ~ 40 years ago ... only a little better. I would actually prefer the good old ice milk from the old days... who needs all that fat?!? The fat free Breyers or the 1/2 fat variety you used to make was quite good, and I'd load up the freezer with it in the summer, but I can't find it near me any more. I'd like a big bowl, and add whatever toppings I wanted-- usually my own grated chocolate for a real choc. chip. Mr. B? I hope this was helpful..."

This was horrible I don’t think even the neighborhood stoner would eat this. I thought breyers was a stand up company but after this I’m left questioning did they mean to offend my tastebuds? Do you like making small children hate their well earned desert time.
34_breyers,Busymomma85,2018-06-18,5,Great ice cream,0,0,Wow I bought this ice cream about a week ago and it was so yummy putting two flavors was a awesome idea if your looking for a ice cream that will put that sweet tooth to rest this is it !
34_breyers,Vieu101,2018-10-15,3,Good Ice Cream,3,1,I tried this flavor today and it was filled with waffle cone and heath pieces. You get more with Breyers. The only complaint I have is that the ice cream had a very odd texture and left a slight aftertaste. Kind of like diet ice cream.
34_breyers,Alex1,2018-04-11,2,Small pieces,1,0,"I was very excited to get this as I've had a new obsession with ice cream with waffle cone pieces! Examples are Ben and Jerry's ""Americone Dream"" and Blue Bell's ""Ice Cream Cone"". However, I was pretty disappointed by this flavor as as it is mostly vanilla/chocolate ice cream with very small pieces of toppings mixed in. I would have loved larger pieces that waffle cone cookie depicted mixed in!"
34_breyers,Linders,2018-06-11,1,Not impressed,3,2,"I somewhat agree with the first review of the Heath and Waffle cone, but I was even reluctant to give it one star. It might not have been quite so bad if you had kept the toffee flavored ice cream, but then again that might not have helped it much either. The Heath Blasts is very good. This most definitely is not."
34_breyers,Chefyes,2019-09-26,2,Not what I was hoping fir,1,0,"I was buying ice cream only for the kids. When I saw the 2/1 heath waffle cone mix. I let them get theirs and I grabbed that one. On the box it shows a swirl and mix of vanilla and chocolate with candy pieces. I was sold and ready for my spoon. I didn’t even wait when I got home I cracked it open and my jaw dropped. My kids asked what’s wrong...”There’s no vanilla in this at all!” Was my reply. I’m not a big chocolate person, but those two flavors on my favorite and it didn’t taste good. It was heavy on the chocolate flavor, which I understand since I got an ice cream with two chocolate flavors. The image showed vanilla which is what really made me feel like a kid in a toy store. The combo of all that. It was sad I didn’t eat it after the first couple spoons. I bought it a week ago and I finally said I would post about it. Not a big posting person. Can it have a little more swirling of flavors. If so I’ll give it a second try thanks"

It was pretty good. I would have like to have bigger chunks of the two flavors. Beside that it was really good and I can’t wait to buy it again. It totally met my sweet tooth craving. My kids even really liked this ice cream so that is a plus too.
I received this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes. I was asked to give my feed back for trying out the product for free."

34_breyers,Indyded,2019-04-07,2,"Less milk fat, more air. It’s not ice cream.",1,0,"The Heath and Waffle Cone 2 in 1 tells you it’s “frozen dairy dessert.” Pay attention. It’s not ice cream. It tastes and, more importantly, feels like a watered-down simulation of ice cream. It has so much air churned into it that it seems to vaporize under your spoon. The flavors are diluted. It seems really no fun."
34_breyers,Kristin,2018-08-23,1,Tasted like milky frozen water,1,0,This ice cream was not good. It tasted like milky frozen water. The heath and waffle cone were barely included. It cost about the same as a pint of Ben and Jerry's or Hagen Daaz and I will continue to enjoy the consistency of those brands instead of this disappointment.
34_breyers,Toffee loving gal,2019-03-08,1,Very disappointing!,1,0,This product had no discernible pieces of Heath and the pieces of waffle cone were rubbery and chewy. I was pretty shocked as Breyers almost always delivers on flavor and quality. Wish I could get my money back for this one.
34_breyers,Lar2010,2018-05-26,1,No Heath- more like Choc/vanilla icecream,1,0,Don’t waste your calories or money! It has NO heath flavor or waffle cone! Was so disappointed. My husband and I always get choc and vanilla for kids. We got this for us as a special treat and we’re SO disappointed.
34_breyers,Lastbloom,2018-05-29,1,Nail Polish Ice Cream?,1,0,My sister and I just ate this ice cream and we both agree that the chocolate pieces taste exactly like nail polish. Not really something I’d ever recommend to anyone. Ever. Seriously don’t eat it.

There were plenty of cookie pieces and the flavors blended well together. It did have a pretty sort consistency, and that's the only drawback. Wasn't as dense as other ice creams, so it seemed like there was less in the container. Not bad considering I received a coupon to get this free from @influenster #gotitfree #breyers"

I thought the overall flavor was good, but there could have been more crushed Heath Bar in it. Also, the chocolate covered cone pieces were ok, but more please! Of the 2 in 1 flavors offered, this was my favorite. I might buy this in the future if it goes on sale or I have a coupon."

Although the ice cream is very delicious, the pecans themselves are, more often than not, rancid and dried up. It happens so often that I wonder why such a high quality ice cream company would use dried up, rancid pecans. I sometimes get one that is very bitter and it ruins the taste of the ice cream. I do love the butter pecan but the rancid pecans ruins it!"
35_breyers,BetseyHF,2018-11-15,5,Taste exactly like the Original!,3,0,"I come from a long line of Breyers family. My grandfather was a refrigeration engineer there back when the average household still had ice boxes, so needless to say we’ve been eating Breyers all my life with Butter Pecan being my mothers and now my favorite. This sugar-free version is a dead ringer for their original. I do not taste any aftertaste from the sweetener, it is rich and buttery and I have not had the problems with the pecans that others have mentioned. The only negative comment is that it’s a little bit fluffy like it has air whipped into it, but I have felt that way about all the Breyers ice cream over the past couple decades, it’s not as thick and heavy as it used to be when I was a kid. I am on keto, I wish they would list net carbs but I’m guessing from the label it is 7 g per serving. Still worth it! Delicious stuff especially over a warmed keto brownie."

I bought a new container last weekend and to my disappointment I discovered it also does not have any candy peices in it at all.  Check out the attached picture.  Zero chocolate and zero taffy.  I've been buying this flavor for years. This now makes 3 containers in 2 months that have been this way.  All I'm getting in the containers is vanilla ice cream with caramel.   That's now about $18.00 wasted. The product in the container looks nothing like the picture on the lid.  You folks need to fix this or just quit selling it.  Time for me to find another brand!!"

I got home, put everything away, made dinner and my family ate. I ran to the pharmacy to pick up a script that I forgot on the way home from first trip. So yea, open the Breyer's, start serving it up. I seriously thought I was being punked. I thought my Mom took out the ""Heath ice cream"" and put in something else. There was NOT ONE PIECE OF CANDY BAR IN ENTIRE CONTAINER ! In addition the consistency was nothing like I'd ever seen. Like cool whip out in a blender with custard then only partially frozen. I'm sad that I had to throw away $6.00. Being disabled on limited income, that's alot."

37_breyers,Angie_5,2020-02-09,1,Horrible!,0,0,Heath is one of my favorite flavors of ice cream. I feel very cheated eating this ice cream. This was suppose to be a treat for me and my husband. We are trying to eat healthier and ice cream is my one treat. There was no Heath pieces in this ice cream. At one point I asked my husband if he put whip topping on the “ice cream”. That’s exactly what it tasted like whip topping and peanuts not ice cream at all. Will not be wasting my money on Breyers Ice Cream again.
37_breyers,reallydontknow,2020-01-24,5,,0,0,"Yes, this is a ""frozen dairy dessert"" and not actually ice cream, but it is very delicious. It has caramel swirls and bits of Heath Bar mixed in. If you like chocolate and caramel, this is right up your alley. This is great served up on a waffle cone, but is yummy all on its own. I usually buy this from the frozen section at Walmart. The price there is reasonable, but I won't usually buy it if it costs more than $5."

At best, it’s like soft serve ice cream (with virtually no cream unfortunately) and at worst seems like a lowfat whipped topping with some small chunks of toffee bar. It’s cold and sweet, but not memorable at all."
37_breyers,Creatr01,2020-08-16,1,I was severely disappointed with this ice cream,0,0,This ice cream was very underwhelming. The ice cream looks like it is just vanilla with maybe 10 very small pieces of something throughout the whole carton. It had no caramel swirl and you wouldn’t be able to tell it had heath pieces unless you were told it did.
37_breyers,Kim123,2019-11-06,1,Disappointing,0,0,"Heath is one of my favorite flavors, but this was chocolate caramel and almond, there were no toffee pieces. Product was mostly air and poor quality dairy dessert. The kids liked it, but I wouldn't purchase it again."

How in the world I go to store wanting Ice Cream, decide to pick up my favorite, Breyers Butter Pecan and there are NOOOOOOOO pecans in the whole DARN container (I use darn because it would let me say the other word. That's how upset I am). Are you Kidding me. I grew up on this Ice Cream. I don't like very much, but I could Always count on My Breyers Butter Pecan Ice Cream. Until Now, what is going on. This is ridiculous. I will NO LONGER PURCHASE (WASTE MY MONEY) ON THIS ICE CREAM EVER AGAIN. If I wanted Vanilla I would have brought Vanilla. How could this happen? The Ice Cream use to be Less than $6.00, not it's higher and less quality. If you pay more the product should be what people expect or better quality. Come on, what is it going to take to get what you pay for these days. I use to love or was happy to taste the pecan. It was like roasted pecans in delicious vanilla ice cream. Now, it's just Vanilla ice cream. NO MORE"
38_breyers,MJ5000,2020-03-30,1,Very disappointing - Butter Pecan Ice Cream,12,0,"So disappointed to have a few bites on Breyers Butter Pecan Ice Cream only to have the worst after-taste left in my mouth. Before looking at ingredients, I already knew there was corn syrup in it!!!---AND sugar!!! So sad. I expected more from Breyers, the same brand that I can rely on for clean, simple ingredients when it comes to vanilla and chocolate ice cream (only 2 flavors that have simple ingredients, for now anyway). As a point of differentiation, please expand your line to meet the consumer demand for healthier options in terms of simple and clean ingredients. Please do not continue to cheapen your product and brand with cheap ingredients."

Used to be a devoted Breyers lover; and Butter Pecan used to be my favourite. But, now it's Hagen Das. Why? Real ice cream doesn't use corn syrup and gums. BP used be Natural Vanilla with added pecans and that was all. Now it's this strange viscous goo. Ever since Unilever took over they've been adding all this junk so as to produce the product more cheaply and therefore sell it cheap. Sometimes it's better to sell a little less at a little more and sell better Mr. Breyer would be very sad if he were still with us."

I know they had frozen dairy dessert flavors but the normal staple flavors like butter pecan were actual ice cream. I was deeply disappointed to get the butter pecan home and find that it too is now filled with poor ingredients, corn syrup etc. Unfortunately, this will be my last purchase of a Breyer's product and I will be more diligent in reading labels on products that I have always purchased as companies are changing ingredients and not alerting that to us on the label!"

However, over the last three years I’ve been immensely disappointed with the quality of this product. The cream tastes doctored, not pure, and the pecans are sometimes burnt and have bits of hull in them which almost makes me gag, ughhh! Biting into that is torture! I can’t ever see myself buying this product again until you fix these issues. Your competition has surpassed you and they give me more for less. You’re gonna need to raise your game, Brewers, if you expect to remain relevant."

The bitter pungent taste and subsequent aftertaste was unbearable. I had to rinse the product from my tastebuds; it took a couple rinses, whewee! Now I've had some bad tasting pecans in this ice cream before, but not this bad! I'll probably go with another brand for my future Butter Pecan fix. Oh and yes the this ice cream could have better flavoring. I was going to provide the product manufacturing info, but based on other reviews it's not just this one container; it's product quality."

I must admit that the first spoonful or two tasted great, until I realized something was a bit ""off"" I noticed a somewhat gummy texture and was instantly suspicious... I checked the side panel of the carton and was shocked at what I read! Artificial additives and gums! Whatever happened to the Breyers pledge of honest easy to read ingredient list? Who was it a kid named Mikey stuttering over another leading brands ingredients? And clearly could read milk,sugar, cream (?) and strawberries on the Breyers label! That said the frozen dessert is misleading when seeing the Breyers label. I noticed that it had the unilever trademark (soap makers) While it was sweet at first taste, the end result will be purchasing a real ice cream product- not this artificial gummy concoction made cheaply."

I made my usual Breyers purchase. Arriving home, I rewarded myself with a giant serving of Breyer's Butter Pecan. Shock!!! For the first time ever it tasted really bad. The pecans were old and rank. I had to throw the whole carton away. It was a while before I purchased any more. Thinking the first event was a fluke, I
tried the Butter Pecan again. Same story again.That puzzled me what with BREYER's rreputation for quality. The jury is still out."

I'm about 3/4 of the way through it and the ""pecan"" count is like 1/8 of 1 Pecan. A tiny piece of pecan. It doesn't look like there's any pecans at all. I'm not exaggerating. I must have got a bad batch. Since I don't see a place to lodge a complaint on the website I guess I'll have to do it here.

I don't eat ice cream often, so I like to buy something I know I'll like when I do. I will always go to Breyers for my Butter Pecan now that I've tried it."

I have a first and second favorite in two other brands so I was interested to see how this stacked up. I can confidently say now that Breyers Buttered Pecan ice cream is a solid third choice if my first two brands aren't available. The flavor of the buttered pecan is not very ""buttered"" and is more like vanilla ice cream with pecans. I prefer mine with the buttery taste. The pecans themselves were a bit softer and soggy than hard and crunchy but their flavor was to die for! The texture was interesting in that it starts out a grainy/gritty kind of texture then transforms into a smooth creamy texture in your mouth. While I have other brand choices in this flavor that I prefer, I will be trying different flavors of the Breyers ice cream as their price is in line with the other major brands."

When I opened it I thought it looked different, so I read the container, and while it's called Butter Pecan, the small print says it is vanilla with buttered pecans. So it is literally just pecans in vanilla ice cream. You should stop calling this butter pecan. It's misleading. Who puts vanilla ice cream in butter pecan?"

I'm kind of an ice cream snob as we in New England eat tons of ice cream and I have so many great places. I didn't have very much hope for this ice cream, given its factory made etc. etc. But I was pleasantly surprised how creamy and rich it was. Also most of the ingredients were pretty natural although I have to say it wasn't 100% natural so that's why I took off one star. Of course my kids loved it but they're hardly connoisseurs. My kids will eat anything ! Thanks for letting us try this product. I would definitely buy it again. The price point was also very attractive not super expensive like some of the Gourmet brands.

38_breyers,Jodeek33,2017-07-26,3,Breyers Butter Pecan,1,0,"I am a huge fan of butter pecan flavored anything so I was excited to give the Breyers Butter Pecan ice cream a try. Before trying this product, you should know the butter pecan flavor in this ice cream is not a strong flavor but more of a mild flavor. It really tastes more of a vanilla ice cream than a butter pecan flavor. I was disappointed with this as you want to be able to taste the buttery sweetness that butter pecan flavor usually exuberates. The pecans in the ice cream were packed full of flavor and had a great crunch to them. They tasted of a toasted nut flavor, crunchy and crisp and not soft or soggy even though they are packed into ice cream. The only downfall with the pecans is that there were not enough in the ice cream. In my opinion, there should have been more quantity of pecans in the ice cream. Overall the ice cream itself is creamy and milky and not thin or watery, but lacks that punch of butter pecan flavor and needs to have more nuts in it."

Ice cream is not one of my usual dessert choices but I do eat more of it during the summer months. The butter pecan had a nice buttery and nutty taste. The texture was smooth and creamy not icy and grainy. Now that I have experienced this great new ice cream flavor, I will be having it along side my pecan pie at the holidays."
38_breyers,ramona0204,2020-08-13,1,So sad the recipe changed,0,0,"I am so disappointed that they changed the Butter Pecan recipe. It used to be THE BEST Butter Pecan ice cream in the world with the most perfect natural sweet cream flavor and savory pecans. Now it is just another crap product on the shelf of fake tasting ""ice cream"". I raved about it to my husband only to be embarrassed when he finally tried it. Shame on Breyers for going against the original owner's philosophy and recipe. Not buying this anymore."
38_breyers,MaryAnn,2018-11-04,1,Tasteless Butter Pecan,0,0,"I grew up on Breyers ice cream, and I worked at a drug store when I was 16 that had a soda fountain. We sold only Breyers and it was GREAT. That was 55 years ago. What you're selling now is awful. Who in the world talked you into destroying your wonderful product? It no longer has any flavor. Based on the other reviews on this page, I have to question whether you'll be able to stay in business. I will not purchase your ice cream again."
38_breyers,Misplacedtexans,2017-08-05,5,Breyers Butter Pecan Ice Cream,0,0,"I haven't had Butter Pecan Ice Cream since I moved to Connecticut from Texas, which has been years! Don't know what I was thinking, since this Butter Pecan ice cream from Breyers is even better than I remembered! The carton went so fast that I ended up having to get another one and hid it behind the sad bag of broccoli in my freezer. Took me back to my childhood when everything was so much easier, will definitely be getting more!"
38_breyers,icedream,2018-08-05,1,Beware - not real ice cream and artificial flavors,0,0,Not your Father's Breyer's anymore. It is sickeningly sweet from the high fructose corn syrup and the texture is very bizarre from all the gums. They are also trying to pull a fast one on their marketing websites and in the packaging acting like this is ice cream - the fine print is this is a frozen dairy desert. Aka. they can pump it up with as much air and artificial chemicals as they want. Unilever why'd you ruin a good thing?
38_breyers,sweetwinter,2017-09-06,5,A memory that melts in your mouth!,0,0,"Breyers Butter Pecan ice cream brought back so many delightful childhood memories of this delicious ice cream! Back before the land of a million flavors, being served butter pecan = celebration! It meant family and good times and great ice cream. Breyers seems to have found a way to make it taste even better than I remember with its amazing creaminess contrasted against the satisfying nuttiness. It was hard not to just sit around the table and hand out spoons to devour an entire half gallon in one sitting among us! The flavor profile stands on its own but I chose to have even more fun and grabbed another half gallon to make sugar cookie/butter pecan ice cream sandwiches for game night and boom! Perfect combo. I highly recommend you pick up some Breyers Butter Pecan for your next get together, TV binge watch or well, Tuesday night ~ you won't be sorry."
38_breyers,enick777,2017-07-31,4,Breyer's Ice Cream,0,0,"Being somewhat of an ice cream expert I give Breyer's 4 out of 4 stars.
The pros: The flavors are rich and really great, the ice cream is a smooth and creamy texture.
The cons: The ice cream is of a softer texture and melted quicker than a traditional hardserve. (But if you are a softserve lover I suppose it's not an issue!)
I like my ice cream full of ""stuff"". Breyer's could add some more ""stuff"" in larger chunks and pieces."
38_breyers,Anonymous,2019-05-20,1,This is a gross chemical dump,0,0,This “frozen dairy dessert” mess is Unilever’s attempt to scrape additional margin at the expense of product quality. We want an indulgent quality treat; this might as well be Butter Pecan Tide Pods. Breyers has violated its brand standards beyond recognition. Notice how the don’t show the FDD language in promo pictures? Breyers is a commodity bottom of barrel brand now. Next Unilever will make QTips out of insulation.
38_breyers,momof2inMS,2018-05-16,1,Very disappointed,0,0,"I have always liked Breyers vanilla Ice Cream. This week I decided to try a different flavor but was very disappointed with the carton of Butter Pecan. The pecans were soft, not buttery and roasted as stated. Many were BITTER and completely inedible. I have thrown away the remainder of the carton! I do hope that this is a minor slip up and not an indication of a major overall decline in quality of Breyers products."
38_breyers,anguyen113,2019-02-11,1,Did not meet my expectations,0,0,"Went to the store craving some butter pecan ice cream. The store did not have the brand I wanted to so I figured Breyer's was a safe choice remembering that I used to enjoy it as a kid. The ice cream is edible but they should have labeled the ice cream ""Vanilla with pecans"", not ""Butter Pecan"". Definitely misleading and to some degree mislabeled. I don't plan on buying this brand ever again--truly a shame."
38_breyers,JAMA,2018-01-16,1,NOT ice cream!,0,0,"As a kid, I had always held Breyers in high regard. It was fairly dense, had only the ingredients it should, and tasted great. Now it can’t even be called ice cream, it’s ‘frozen dairy dessert’. It’s got corn syrup, gums and other fillers. And it’s so full of air it has the texture of chilled foam. Gross! I told my wife we will never buy another package of Breyers."
38_breyers,SMGstar,2017-07-20,5,A Timeless Classic,0,0,"Breyers is the gold standard in ice cream for my family. I am not exaggerating,(though it will sound like over-dramatization), when I say that there are usually between 4-6 cartons of Breyers ice cream in my inlaws' freezer at a time. While they are basic Chocolate and Neapolitan folks, Breyers Butter Pecan ice cream was just the flavor I needed to perk up these hot summer days.
The first thing to note is how incredibly creamy it is. I fully believe that it's made with real, natural ingredients because you can absolutely taste the difference. The second thing is how that buttery smooth flavor hits your palette the second you take a bite. It's rich and delicious. It has a strong vanilla base but the buttery cream really stands out! And finally, those pecan chunks give it a delightful bit of texture and help taper the sweetness.
It's everything you would love about Classic butter pecan flavor, but executed perfectly."
38_breyers,DAWG,2018-03-31,1,Frozen Dairy GARBAGE!!!,0,0,"Not anything remotely close to the ""ice cream"" I grew up with. Extremely disappointing. ""Frozen Dairy Dessert"" is not ice cream. Tasted like vanilla bean whipped topping with stale pecans...which were very few and far between. What happened to the simple all natural ingredients we all loved?? Replaced with artificial fillers to save a buck?? What a joke. #epicfail"
38_breyers,donna15,2017-07-26,5,Yummy ice cream,0,0,I think the breyers butter pecan ice cream is delicious. It is so creamy and buttery. The pecans are just right. My son is very picky about his ice cream and he loved it. We will definitely try other flavors of breyers ice cream. I would say it is in our top three of brands of ice cream. I would definitely recommend this ice cream to friends and family.
38_breyers,ice cream aficionado,2018-08-06,1,Horrible ... NOT ice cream,0,0,"I am an ice cream aficionado. My preference is home made ice cream with real cream and real sugar. As for store-bought ice cream, I used to buy Breyers ages ago because it was the standard by which all others were measured. I stopped buying Breyers ages ago when they reduced their 1/2 gallon carton down to a reduced size. I love ice cream; why would I want less???
My wife bought some Breyers Butter Pecan today because the store had a ""Buy one / Get One"" sale. The stuff was horrible; it wasn't even ice cream any more. It had a gooey texture, rather than a natural IceCream-texture; the flavor had a sickening sweetness to it rather than the natural Breyers flavor of ages ago; and lastly, it had an after taste that was strange and unpleasant. This is not the Breyers natural ice cream that they used to make ages ago.
This stuff is so far removed from the old natural Breyers that I wouldn't even call this stuff ice cream any more."
38_breyers,tom6,2018-05-31,1,Disappointing~ Pecan Shells in ice cream,0,0,"So, I posted a review last week concerning Pecan Shells in the ice cream, get an email stating ""It cannot be published to the website, but.."" with a picture of the word Breyers. It's okay for you to post someone else's review of Butter Pecan with No Pecans, but not a post with the shells in the box. This Will be the LAST box of Breyers I buy"
38_breyers,Cybergirl,2020-09-27,2,Not what you would expect from Bryers,0,0,Bryers used to have a commercial about how their ice cream only had a few pure ingredients. I bought butter pecan without checking the ingredients. Then I opened the box and noticed it was yellowish instead of the cream color like what is on the box. I don’t want corn syrup in my ice cream. Really disappointed in this product.

I admit I was in a hurry, but I thought I was safe from gypsy tricks or product changes. When I was a kid, I remember eating Breyers Butter Pecan Ice Cream. Not any longer...it is now referred to as a Frozen Dairy Dessert because they altered the ingredients."

38_breyers,Beck,2020-03-30,1,Why,0,0,Butter pecan ice cream is just not good. If I were looking at all the different ice cream flavors at the store I don’t think I would look at butter pecan and decide that that was the ice cream for me. It has such a boring taste and I don’t know why anyone would buy it. Ew.

I don't want to eat any of the homemade options, they taste good, but are loaded with heavy whipping cream. This is probably the best thing I've had in months other than lily's caramel chocolate bar. These were amazing enough for me to take time out of my day to write this review, which is not something I would normally do. The box cost me $3.77; about the same price as one of the lilys candy bars, and each bar only has 60 calories!

40_breyers,CaptainRosie,2019-11-07,5,Love the surprise,0,0,"I picked these up thinking they were vanilla, and was confused how vanilla could have more calories than chocolate, but no matter. I was so pleasantly surprised to realize they were actually mint! As a diabetic, I'm so tired of having such limited options. Usually just chocolate and vanilla. I love these. Not to mention they're so soft and creamy. Also to the people who want them covered in chocolate, I see where you're coming from, but dipping it in chocolate would add more calories!! So careful what you wish for!!"

Unfortunately, the switch to the chocolate swirl mint greatly misses the mark. For some strange reason, the mint flavor has been changed, diminishing the original rich taste until it’s much more bland now. The chocolate swirl is superfluous. Disappointing and a major miss..."

42_breyers,icecreamlover8,2018-10-17,1,"Worst ""frozen dairy desert"" ever",5,3,"While the Reeces logo caught my eye and had me gravitate towards it, this concoction, from the moment I opened it to the second it hit my taste buds, it was utter disappointment. I know its not supposed to be ice cream, but how deceiving it is to someone who doesn't read the smaller labels. This is literally the worst frozen thing I ever put in my mouth, and I am a die hard chocolate and anything peanut butter fan. The product tasted all icy, like as if i took a regular milk, sugar, and flavoring and froze it. Terrible, terrible. Breyer's you need to change your game. I highly doubt this is what the people want. I will never be buying Breyer's again."
42_breyers,KGilbert,2018-09-06,1,Absolutely disappointing,2,1,This pregnant woman is not happy!! Chocolate and peanut butter have been major cravings so I HAD to buy this icecream only to find out what I really got is plain chocolate ice cream. No sign of ANYTHING else. It's not like I can return the carton to the store to get my money back either. I didn't even want to give this a one star rating.
42_breyers,Heavy preggers,2018-09-12,1,Plain chocolate,2,1,There was nothing in this ice cream. It’s just plain chocolate. I suppose they aren’t lying when they say 35% more. Since a percentage of zero is a multiplication and zero times anything is always going to be zero.
42_breyers,jl316,2020-05-16,2,Disappointing flavor!,0,0,"When I saw the Reese's chocolate flavor of Breyer's, I was so excited! I am a huge fan of the peanut butter and chocolate ice cream at Baskin Robbins and expected it to be similar. Boy was I disappointed! This is not even actually ice cream but considered a ""dairy dessert."" In addition to that, it has very little flavor other than the candy. It definitely does not taste like chocolate ice cream. I am a big fan of Breyer's natural vanilla, so thought I couldn't go wrong with another flavor. Will not be purchasing any other Breyer's flavors from now on other than the natural vanilla."
42_breyers,SadPanda,2018-09-17,1,Total let down!,1,2,"I have had the regular Reese's cup flavor ice cream multiple times and always loved it. So when i saw the chocolate flavor, I thought it would be even better! Well, at least the cats enjoyed it. I should have saved my money and bought actual Reese's cups. This entire carton had ZERO pieces of Reese's cups in it, no peanut butter, nothing but chocolate ice cream, with a tasteless speck of something gritty here and there. If there had been a smidge of peanut butter flavor, I might have been able to convince myself it was a microscopic remnant of a Reese's cup, but, no dice. I will allot the carton one star, since as I mentioned above, the cats seemed to find no difference in the melted leftovers from any other flavor."
42_breyers,Niju,2018-12-26,5,My Favorite!,1,0,"Despite the others that dislike this product, it is my absolute favorite. I am sad that this is hard to find now though and has been replaced with the Vanilla version instead in most stores around me. Don't be deceived by the negative reviews left here. Just read them and see how unrelated to the actual product they are and not an actual review of the product or due to their inability to read etc. An absolute must for chocolate and peanut butter fans."
42_breyers,Reeseslover4,2018-05-29,2,Where are the Reeses and peanut butter?,3,2,I rarely complain about products. I agree with others who have said it has barely any Reese’s or peanut butter. It’s basically just a mild chocolate ice cream. I won’t buy again unless they say “we’ve beefed it up with more Reese’s.”
42_breyers,Zach,2018-10-18,5,Vanilla Reeses,1,0,I picked up the vanilla reeses from Breyers. It was very good considered the price. I'm a breyers buyer tho. I eat all the flavors from breyers. But with that said good product for the price.
42_breyers,Pat33379,2018-06-27,5,Fantastic,1,0,This has half the calories of any B and J and it’s better than most. Calorie for calorie this is the best ice cream on the planet.

42_breyers,alexc1,2020-09-22,5,,0,0,I LOVE Reeses and this ice cream is my absolute favorite. The only reason why I don't eat it way more than I'd like to is because I'm lactose intolerant. I really hope and wish they make a lactose free version. It's not too chocolatey either (like most peanut butter cup things). The texture is a tad softer than your average brand and I think it's because of the peanut butter but I do not mind it.
42_breyers,shalamarmermaid,2020-09-21,1,,0,0,When I saw this flavor I was excited to try the ice cream. Chocolate and Reese's candy with an extra swirl of peanut butter sounded delicious. What a disappointment when I opened the carton. This was nothing more than plain chocolate ice cream. Where was the Reese's? Where is the peanut butter swirl? There was so little of either that I was one and done with this flavor.
42_breyers,Hillary,2019-11-26,3,Was my favorite...,0,0,I have bought this many times and it always had tons of peanut butter and tons of peanut butter cup chunks. I hadn’t bought it in a few months and bought some this weekend and am very disappointed. There are very few peanut butter cup chunks and I haven’t found any peanut butter swirl. This now leaves a lot to be desired. Please fix it and go back to the way it was!!!
42_breyers,Katy24,2018-09-15,1,Misleading title,1,1,The ice cream cover led me to believe that there was going to be pieces of Reese’s in it. Unfortunately it’s all chocolate ice cream- no pieces of anything.

This is super delicious and I Highly recommend trying this. It’s actually super good the only reason I’m giving at four stars instead of five is because a peanut butter taste a little bit funny in my personal opinion.￼￼"
42_breyers,jenniferfussell1,2020-09-21,4,,0,0,It tastes close to Reeses and has chips in it. I do believe it could taste a tad but more like them. It's good on occasion and will buy more. Price point is OK for the brand. I do add more Reese Cups to mine though. Good for a change of pace in ice cream. #sweets #sweettooth #icecream #snacks #food #reeses #chocolate
42_breyers,noswirl,2020-05-29,1,No peanut butter swirl,0,0,So disappointed! I love peanut butter and chocolate ice cream. But all that was in the container was chocolate ice cream with chocolate chunks and maybe a vague peanut butter taste. It was completely missing the peanut butter swirl that is showing in the picture on the carton. Won't be purchasing this again.
42_breyers,mandyt11,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,This is by far my favorite ice cream. It is so good with the different flavors and adding Reesie’s into it which they have increased. It is a bit pricey but I wait for it to go on sale and buy a couple at a time. It lasts the family a while since we don’t eat the whole carton at one setting LOL
42_breyers,Jackie271,2020-09-14,1,Tasteless,0,0,The icecream base is almost tasteless. I even tried adding chocolate syrup to ad flavour but it just did not help. It consists of a tasteless base very few chunks of “peanut butter swirl” and a few big chunks of Reese’s. Ratios were just not right and was left throughly disappointed.
42_breyers,Sam5,2020-03-08,1,Not what I expected,0,0,I bought this thinking it was going to be awesome because it was from Breyers but it tur ed out to be the opposite the chocolate was waxy no peanut butter was in it and the Icecream was not creamy it didn't even taste like chocolate very disappointed will not buy it again.
42_breyers,felicias,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,I am a big Reese's fan and whoa this ice cream is a dream in my mouth. Ice cream and Reese's... can't get any better than that! This Ice Cream is the real deal but just make sure you don't eat the whole container (Its that good). What more can I say.... go out and buy some!
42_breyers,caprim1,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,Love this ice cream and brand!!! The taste is amazing compared to others that I have tried. It’s just the right ratio. I wouldn’t change anything about this product. I’m extremely satisfied with this product and would happily recommend to anyone looking for a sweet treat.
42_breyers,mariaz15,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,This is a really nice treat to have if you love chocolate and peanut butter. The peanut butter pieces are a much sweeter taste then you would expect. But I didnt mind. Every spoonful was a great mixer in every bite. On top of a brownie it was a great treat at a party.
42_breyers,tiersaf,2020-09-22,4,,0,0,Decent ice cream with a rich creamy reese's flavor. Definitely worth the price although the container isnt big enough to last a family of 4 very long. We did enjoy it and will probably purchase more in the future when they are on sale. Didntblast long in the freezer
42_breyers,deanab,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"I don't even know how you can say anything bad about Reese's. They are definitely a favorite in this house. Such good toppings for ice cream, cakes, cookies, or even just by themselves. Easy to find at any store and on the lower end of price and higher end of quality."
42_breyers,tinydemon101,2020-09-21,2,,0,0,"Can’t even lie, this ice cream didn’t even taste like peanut butter at all. It just tasted like frozen nothing with chunks in it, the chocolate isn’t rich enough to activate my pallet and I was so severely disappointed. We bought it at a discount and now we know why!"
42_breyers,valeries68,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"It is so yummy! When I buy Reese’s cups I always have to freeze them before eating. Now you have the best of both worlds!

42_breyers,maddym33,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,This had the creamiest texture I have had when indulging in ice cream. This brand is super affordable! It could be improved by adding more Reese’s chunks. It was very very delicious especially since I love Reese’s and I could see myself buying it again.
42_breyers,Savvy,2019-07-28,1,No peanut butter swirl :(,0,0,"So, I don't buy ice cream often because of guilt--probably only buy it twice a year--so when I do buy it, it is a big deal to me. Mega splurge, super wonderful, etc. I specifically bought this one for the peanut butter swirl, because that's my ABSOLUTE favorite part, but I also like the Reese cup pieces too. I just finished this one I bought last week and was really disappointed to find no peanut butter swirl at all in the whole 1.5 quarts of it. The Reese cup pieces were few and far between, though oddly enough they were also massive, to the point of being difficult to bite. I was searching online, thinking maybe there was a faulty batch or something, and when I saw others with the same complaints, I figured I should share my experience too. As a teacher who was looking forward to some blissful indulgence during the last week before the new school year, I'm pretty let down. This was just chocolate ice cream with about a dozen lumps of peanut butter cups here and there. I hate to think what it had been before the ""35% more"" upgrade."

I am sad to see this recipe change and hope the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup hasn't changed! I was also very disappointed when the Samoas was discontinued.

45_breyers,Xandersmom,2018-08-10,1,No strawberry swirl??,3,0,"So I went into Walmart today with the intention of buying the ben&jerry’s chocolate caramel cheesecake truffle ice cream but it’s like 5 bucks for a pint, so I saw this and thought I’d try it since it was twice as much ice cream but half the price. Sooooo regret my choice. I took the first bite, immediately disappointed. But I thought ok, maybe I need to get some of the strawberry swirl in with it... I preceded to dig through the whole carton, NO SWIRL. And I’m not talking like oh there’s some swirl but very little.. no, literally none, not a spec of strawberry. On top of that I think there was 5 total pieces of cheesecake in the whole thing. I googled it to see if anyone else had this happen, didn’t see any other complaints about it but I didn’t look very hard either. I don’t see how I could be the only one with this problem. I took some pictures, the lighting isn’t very good, but I assure you I did not get a drop of strawberry in the dang thing. Bummed... I’ll be expecting a replacement carton at my doorstep by 9am tomorrow morning, and it better be packed with swirl dangit."

45_breyers,BOBKEV,2019-08-19,4,New york style cheesecake icecream,0,0,Could you guy make a carb friendly version of this icecream. There are 13g of sugar each serving if you replaced the sugar with erythritol or stevia this would be great for lowcarb and diabetics. 5net carbs per serving.
45_breyers,tschill32,2018-09-09,1,So bad !,1,0,Very disappointed doesn’t taste anything like strawberry cheesecake at all taste more of like a birthday cake of some sort and barely any cheesecake bits waste of money will never purchase breyers again usually never do because of how expensive but wanted to see if this was any good AND ITS NOT !

45_breyers,Bennynme,2018-06-20,3,Not as good,5,0,I loved yr sara lee strawberry cheesecake then u went to ny style which seems to me less strawberry and cheese Its like vanilla ice cream not the same.not as good
45_breyers,Mynn,2018-09-02,1,Dissapointed,3,0,The taste is like pink strawberry ice cream with a weird very weird cheesecake artificial flavored added. Haven't seen a single piece of cheesecake or crumb yet. Wish I've bought the double chocolate truffle instead which I love

I get home, fixes me a big bowl only to be disappointed! This does not taste good ! I love Strawberry cheesecake but this taste like a bad off brand. I had to do some research because this is not how I remembered this tasting. Can you guys please please bring back the Sara Lee version of Strawberry cheesecake. This was a complete waste of money"

45_breyers,Nickname,2020-04-08,2,"Calling it ""cheesecake"" is quite a stretch.",1,0,"I've always been on breyers fan but this one is a swing and a miss. Strawberry flavor is a little weird but would be tolerable and even good if it actually had any cheesecake in it. Only 2 or 3 pieces in a half a container. When you actually get a bite with some in it it's pretty good, but good luck finding any."
45_breyers,theothersider,2020-09-06,3,No Cheesecake,0,0,"I usually buy the natural vanilla or vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and I have always been pleased with Breyers flavor and quality. However, Safeway was out of both so I purchased the New York cheesecake. I was immediately disappointed with the bland flavor. Also, the picture shows strawberry swirl and cheesecake pieces but I didn't get either one. Reading the other reviews, it sounds like Beyers has a quality control issue with this product."

I was so excited when I saw New York style cheesecake flavor at Walmart. the only way I could get cheesecake ice cream wAs at a ice cream parlor. $3.50 a cone and Perry’s changed their cheesecake last year, to more of a vanilla with very little fruit swirl. My only problem is that I only bought one to try and more. I Love this Breyer’s New York Style Cheesecake Ice cream"
45_breyers,C9151,2018-07-24,1,Not New York Style Cheesecake,1,1,This is the worst. Fake strawberry swirls with no flavor. Ice cream has no cheesecake flavor. The only cheesecake flavor is the weird little balls of cheese no graham cracker crust at all. Very disappointing. Save your money.
45_breyers,Beth1966,2018-08-13,2,Tasted artificial,1,1,"Did not care for this flavor at all, as it tasted bland, artificial, and lacked the strawberry swirl. The Sara Lee strawberry cheesecake flavor Breyers featured a year or two ago was SO much better!"

Struggled to put my finger on the flavor I tasted. It was like a mild butterscotch on very creamy ice cream without vanilla...This was the 4th brand in this flavor for me to try this week so very familiar...had high hopes but I will have to pass on this flavor

I was afforded a carton which contained excessive quantities of both the former and the latter. I purchased my carton from Shoppers in May of 2019.

46_breyers,Deb356,2018-03-06,1,Breyer’s Rocky Road? Yuck!,14,2,"I used to love Breyer’s rocky road ice cream. Now it’s that fake “frozen dessert” that is not worth eating. Just in the last year or two it has gotten so much worse. The chocolate in the ice cream and covering the almonds tastes cheap. The texture is gross like fake ice creams have. Can hardly find any marshmallow and those chocolate covered almonds? If it didn’t say they were almonds you’d never know. If you are hungry for the good rocky road ice cream you remember, you won’t find it here! Back to Haagen Daz for me. The extra cost is worth it - I’ll just wait for a sale and buy less of it. Win/win!"
46_breyers,vads,2018-01-31,1,What Happened?,14,0,"This flavor used to be one of my go to's for Breyers, but this flavor tastes strange now. Something has been changed. It looks like chocolate ice cream with marshmallow swirl, but I didn't taste any chocolate, only marshmallow. And even the marshmallow tastes weird. I'm completely dissatisfied with rocky road. Bring back the former recipe!"
46_breyers,Mellywelly,2018-01-07,2,Something is different!,13,0,"We are a family of six, with three teenage sons. Breyers has been a staple in our freezer for year. The last carton of Rocky Road we bought was very different. We all noticed it! To me, the nuts had a strange taste - almost like rancid peanuts! Quality is going down hill. You're losing faithful customers."
46_breyers,Patsy27,2018-03-08,1,Disappointing,10,1,"I do not usually buy Breyers. I thought I would give it a try. Rocky Road has been a favorite flavor, but I was very disappointed. The texture was off. It was not rich and creamy. Tasted like ice cream that had thawed and been refrozen. Where is the gooey marshmallow? Pretty much on existent.
The chocolate covered almonds were like balls of fake chocolate. Terrible product!
Going back to Blue Bunny!!!"
46_breyers,johnjr,2017-11-07,1,Unique flavor this time,12,2,my wife and i both thought that this last batch had a unique flavor that wasn't great.

And seeing that Breyers has all the flavors your can dream of. Glad Rocky Road was one of them. I guess everybody has truly different taste buds than me. One reviewer said that it taste like ""black licorice"". I know what that taste like and that's FAR from it. And another reviewer says the chocolate covered almonds and chocolate tasted ""cheap"". I didn't think so. And I think it's perfect amount of gooey marshmallows you put in it. One reviewer said there wasn't enough. All in all. Another DELICIOUS AND FANTASTIC ice cream from Breyers!!

46_breyers,BinNJ,2018-02-25,1,Weird Taste,3,0,This WAS my favorite ice cream. I don't know what you guys did but it taste weird now. Just go back to making good tasting chocolate ice cream instead of messing around in the food lab.

46_breyers,Ali214,2019-03-14,1,What happened?,2,0,"What happened to Rocky Road? This used to be my favorite. I was craving the crunchy nuts and marshmallows, but got some kind of weird chocolate covered nuts that were waxy and not crunchy at all. I actually picked them all out, yuck. Why change something that was so delicious?"
46_breyers,Mprz,2018-05-29,1,So sad :(,2,0,"I LOVE rocky road ice cream, but this one is the worst! The texture is off as it has melted marshmallows in it opposed to regular marshmallow squares and the chocolate covered almonds taste like black licquorice. Definitely won't be buying the flavored brand again."
46_breyers,Mimi,2018-11-18,4,Great ice cream,10,6,This is a great ice cream it tastes amazing! But the only thing it needs is more marshmallow:)
46_breyers,Disappointed2,2018-10-10,1,What happened?!,2,0,"This used to be my favorite ice cream, but this last carton I bought is completely different. It’s not creamy, hardly any marshmallow and there’s a coating on the nuts that has a weird, gross texture. I’m switching to a different brand."
46_breyers,Mjd1,2018-04-18,1,Gross.,2,0,I completely dislike the coating over the nut bits in this ice cream. Gross stuff. Doesn’t taste almonds to me at all and just leaves a terrible aftertaste in the mouth. Rocky road used to be good but not from this brand.
46_breyers,Mark and di,2018-05-24,2,Something's changed,2,0,"My husband and I bought Rocky road ice cream and were very disappointed in the quality. It wasn't as tasty. Didn't have a good chocolate flavor, and just seemed bland. So disappointed in the Rocky road ice cream"

46_breyers,Kristi33,2019-06-11,1,The worse rocky road,1,0,I’m very disappointed in this rocky road Ice cream. Rocky road has always been my favorite. But this taste so extra sweet like it has so much added sugar. The chocolate covered almonds is just over board and the chocolate on the taste cheap. And the gooey marshmallow cream is just yuck! I’ve never been more disappointed in ice cream than I am now.
46_breyers,icecreamqueen007,2019-01-28,1,Horrible flavor!,1,0,"This is one of the worst ice cream flavors I’ve ever tried. Please sample your competitors’ rocky road and actually put almonds in it. And better chocolate. I agree with another person who said the chocolate-covered nuts taste like black licorice. And I really don’t like black licorice. This needs to be revamped, Breyers!"
46_breyers,MrsC,2018-07-30,2,Not Really Rocky Road,1,0,"I was in a hurry when I bought this, and didn't discover until later it contained carrageenan, an ingredient I try to avoid. My disappointment increased upon sampling it because this ""frozen dessert"" is lacking any actual marshmallows or natural almonds, which in my opinion is what makes rocky road a great flavor."
46_breyers,Amelia75,2018-01-27,2,What happened?,2,1,"I bought a carton of Rocky Road today and was so excited to eat it tonight. Whoa! What happened? The ice cream did not taste chocolatey, there were barely any marshmallows and why was the nut covered in some type of chocolate flavoring. So disappointed in my Breyers! ☹️"
46_breyers,chocolatelover,2017-08-20,2,"Chocolate almonds great, chocolate base blah",1,0,So I was expecting the chocolate ice cream or 'frozen dairy dessert' base to be just as delicious as the plain chocolate flavor and it wasn't at all. It was subpar and almost ruined the ice cream if not for the delicious chocolate covered almonds.
46_breyers,JNGGG,2020-06-11,5,My favorite ice cream,0,0,"Holly cow! I cant believe some of these reviews! If this tasted like black licorice then you must have gotten a bad batch. This is my favorite rocky road ice cream of all time. And believe me, as a chocolate lover fanatic I have tried it all. I keep coming back to this one. Please Breyers don’t ever change this recipe. I love the thick marshmallow tracks and the chocolate covered nuts. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Thank you for making the best rocky road!"
46_breyers,Jcam,2020-09-25,5,My favorite,0,0,"I never liked Rocky Road ice cream in general. Something about the clumps of soggy marshmallows was not appealing to me at all. I got Breyers rocky road by accident one day and it’s been my favorite ice cream ever since. It’s a marshmallow cream swirled throughout rather than clumps. The chocolate ice cream is very good and just the right amount of nuts which are chocolate covered, making it even better."
46_breyers,Tommy6794,2019-01-13,5,Nice touch to lightly salt the almonds...,0,0,"I love this Rocky Road. I first discovered this about 5 years ago and was hooked. I recently bought a new carton after a hiatus and noticed it changed a little bit? Is this true? I think you changed the marshmallow formula a little. Any light that could be shed would be helpful. I still like it, but my preference would be to change it back. Thanks! I only buy Breyers! Natural vanilla is my favorite!"
46_breyers,Andrea,2019-02-05,3,Usually my favorite.,0,0,It’s a great choice for rocky road which is hard to find nowadays. Usually my favorite part is the chocolate covered nuts however- this time they tasted like chocolate cherry covered nuts which was terrible. Hoping it’s not a new thing. Never expierence this before. Overall perfect mix of chocolate marshmallow and almonds.

46_breyers,Shep,2019-08-19,4,Yummy!,0,4,"I'd rate this 5 stars if Breyers made it with real mini marshmallows as opposed to the marshmallow swirl. In fact, I'd never eat another brand/type of ice cream if they included those with the chocolate covered almonds."
46_breyers,simone17,2019-08-19,5,Better than others I’ve tried,0,1,Breyers Rocky Road is better than other brands that I’ve tried because the others didn’t coat the almonds in chocolate. Simple. You’ve brought me back to eating chocolate ice cream.
46_breyers,Zenith,2020-01-24,5,Delicious,0,0,Usually people aren't welcoming to new flavors and/or texture but whatever changed was awesome. My only question is about gelatin. Does the marshmallow swirls contain gelatin?

47_breyers,Crushed,2020-07-21,1,Case of the missing cherries,1,0,"Bought home the “cherry” vanilla tub hoping it would look like the picture on the box. I scooped out about 3/4 of the box and examined each scoop
carefully for signs of a cherry. I couldn’t even find a piece of cherry skin, not even a pit, stem, or hint of natural cherry coloring left behind. It’s like opening a box of lucky charms only to find the kids ate all the marshmallows. Dang kids always stealing me lucky charms. It’s like Luke finding out Vader was his father. Noooooooo!!! Ben..uh Breyers...why didn’t you tell me??"

I mean I love buying this, and I always buy it, every spring & all summer but I’m always left with an enormous amount of vanilla ice cream that I have to get rid of because I don’t like eating a lot of ice cream. But those cherries are amazing and you guys would sell a lot more of this ice cream if you would double or even triple the amount of halved cherries you put in. In the meantime I will keep buying it and I will keep fishing my cherries out. Lol!"
47_breyers,Lisa163,2019-07-29,1,Not the Same,5,0,"Where do I start? I could go into detail, but, I guess to summarize it best, I will simply say that this cannot be categorized as food.....let alone as ice cream. I assume Breyers knows this—thus the name change to “frozen dairy dessert” (whatever this means). The Cherry Vanilla tastes like it was produced in a laboratory......straight out of a beaker. Such a shame. Breyers used to have great ice cream. I used to love the Cherry Vanilla flavor. Cherry Vanilla is not even a shadow of its former self. I took several bites and threw the contents of the bowl and the remainder of the half gallon down the disposal. Congratulations Breyers. Your Cherry Vanilla is now to ice cream what Velveeta is to cheese."

Just bought a carton of Cherry Vanilla Frozen Dairy Dessert today - my first in several years. The product was soft and I thought it had been thawed. After keeping in freezer at minus ten for several hours it never firmed. The texture is also really off. It doesn't feel right on your tongue, it's too soft, and just isn't ice cream. I'll not buy it again."
47_breyers,iloveicecream123,2017-09-24,1,Tastes Medicated,14,1,I have been buying Breyer's Cherry Vanilla for years but stopped for a while and have just recently bought it again. The recipe is totally different than what it used to be. On first taste I got this weird medicated taste. It's actually horrible. Go back to the old recipe! I would not recommend this flavor and will not be buying this again.

I am disssppointed with the lack of cherries in the last 2 half gallons I purchased. It is hard enough to find down here in the south but when found to find it lacking is very upsetting.
I'm sorry I will still not buy any other brand but I may have to give up in the cherry vanilla. I lived in Philly for 35 yrs and would never find a better brand than Breyers!"

I counted 3 cherry halves in this last one we just shined off. I bought some frozen cherries to add in but those were awful compared to the juicy breyers ones.

47_breyers,Ilikeicecream,2019-03-15,2,What is this? Not what my buds remember growing up,4,0,"I vividly remember this being my dad's next favorite ice cream behind breyers chocolate back when I was growing up in the 70's. I liked it too and remember how much I liked how cool and tastey it felt going down in the hot summers. I remember it being actually Frozen and when it melted it being a liquid unlike that frothy other brand me and my sisters despised called sealtest. I bought a container of this two days ago and just opened it and was surprised to see that it was soft, not really frozen. Tasting it left a faint taste of cough syrup, but nothing unbearable. The biggest disappoinment was the foamy consistency as it melted and the ultimate let down was the complete lack of a satisfactory experience on my pallet once it was gone. It just didn't have that consistent cold experience that real ice cream gives when eaten. It honestly reminded me immediately of that other brand that I was so disappointed to see appear in the grocery bags when I was a kid. What happened?"
47_breyers,Channeezy,2018-07-16,5,Great taste!,1,2,Breyer's Cherry Vanilla is my husband's favorite ice cream. It has such simple ingredients but it tastes so good. Having a cone after dinner is a great end to a good meal and a great night. It's definitely a treat we all enjoy and I'd recommend to others. Haven't had a flavor I didn't like.

Now I keep trying flavors and they go uneaten in my freezer. I thought I'd go back to my childhood standby, Cherry Vanilla. It didn't taste like ice cream at all. In fact, it had no flavor except for the unnaturally sweet cherries. I'm so disappointed Breyer's stopped using natural ingredients and turned all my favorites ice creams into ""frozen treats""."
47_breyers,Lollipop,2018-10-24,1,Buyer Beware,2,1,"This is not a high quality, natural tasting, delictable product. I was tricked as others were into thinking this was all natural ice cream. Besides the noticeable gummy texture, the texture is all wrong. I never toss ice cream out because I am an ice cream lover, but I can’t get through the container.
Take a moment and read the labels. I won’t make this mistake again. I’m going back to mint chocolate chip and butter pecan. I hope there hasn’t been changes in their formulations."

They have lots of other varieties of Breyers. This was my favorite. I do not like chocolate in my ice cream (really strange, eh?) and almost everything has chocolate in it (Butter Pecan, works too). Your website still shows it is available. I do note that some reviews say you have changed the recipe and it is not as good as before. What can I do?"

I guess kudos to your Marketing team bc I thought every time I bought your “ice cream” I was feeding my family a good ice cream. Sadly, cream isn’t even on the ingredient list and you use skim milk. It’s no wonder you have to add corn syrup, sugar and fructose. ALL of your products will stay at the store rather than come home to my family from now on. I only wish I had known sooner."

49_breyers,LPats,2017-08-12,1,No cookie dough,12,0,We basically got only chocolate chip and absolutely no cooke dough. We really thought maybe the cookie dough just settled but there was definitely no chewy cookie dough chunks as advertised.
49_breyers,CookieDoughQueen,2018-02-28,2,Something Changed - Boo :(,7,0,"Something is wrong with the cookie dough; it's no longer chewy and rich like before. Now it simply crumbles/disintegrates when you chew it and it tastes like a graham cracker - YUCK. I may give it another try before entirely ruling this brand/flavor out; this has been my favorite cookie dough ice cream for many years, so it may be worth giving it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe, just maybe, I got an off batch... (However, more likely than not, a beloved brand's recipe is being manipulated by the bottom line and the quality is simply taking a nosedive. Oh, well. What do you expect in a consumerist culture, right?)"
49_breyers,Kwhip,2018-05-24,1,Disappointed,4,1,"I bought a half gallon of the chocolate chip cookie dough as a weekly dessert and have to say i was so disappointed with the flavor that I didn’t eat it.
Something seemed wrong with it as it smelled like spoiled milk and didn’t taste any better. I came straight home fro. The grocery store and it did not melt in any way. When I opened it that evening after dinner for some it didn’t seem right. Driving ll the way back to the store didn’t seem worth it.
I have all of the information from the package if you want the details.
This is the very first time I have ever been disappointed in your ice cream so I thought I would let you know."
49_breyers,Kali,2018-04-07,1,Ew,6,0,"Breyers used to have the best stuff, and the cookie dough was always a solid choice. But, we just bought it last night (after not having any for a few months) and... it tastes really bad. There's this strong aftertaste that reminds me of sweet and low (kind of that... hyper sweet, metallic sort of flavor). It does not appear to contain anything like that, which is perhaps even more troubling because ... why does it taste like that, then? It really shouldn't taste like that at all. It was really unpleasant.
It wasn't expired, or even close to expiring. Threw the rest of it away. Ew."
49_breyers,Bezzerk,2018-02-04,1,Low Quality,6,0,I'm not sure where to begin. The aftertaste of this ice cream leaves a bitter taste in my mouth unlike any other ice cream product I've had before. The cookie was plentiful but honestly was the only good part of this product. I rather have collected all the cookie dough and ate it that way so that I could avoid the ice cream part. I've enjoyed other Breyer products and cannot understand why this one is different. Could it be that this ice cream product is not actually ice cream but Frozen Dairy Desert? Disappointing.
49_breyers,LinMed,2018-12-05,1,What Did I Just Eat?,3,0,"First of all, ""Frozen Dairy Dessert"" is a terrible excuse for ice cream, and I already know this, but I was tired and not thinking clearly when I went grocery shopping. I thought I was putting actual ice cream in my cart. Imagine my disappointment when one evening after work I was looking forward to mowing down on some ice cream and I open my freezer to this atrocity.
Secondly, where are the cookie dough pieces and chocolate chips? If you consider every handful of bites enough to be satisfactory, you're sorely mistaken.
Thirdly, has anyone at Breyers actually tasted this nonsense? If so, they should be reassigned to another position.
Breyers, read your reviews. This is not a product that people enjoy eating."
49_breyers,Noel,2017-10-03,1,HORRIBLE,5,2,I purchased breyers chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and it's safe to say I will NEVER be purchasing it again .

When I saw that my local grocery store had this ice cream on sale, I thought I try it. While the ice cream was fresh, there wasn't much flavor and wasn't as rich as other brands that I've tried. What made me most disappointed was the cookie dough was not soft, chewy and rich like you'd expect. the cookie dough pieces were crunch and gritty (almost like a graham cracker like another reviewer mentioned). I will have to go back to the other brand that I've been eating until Breyer's develops a new recipe."

This evening we opened a gallon of the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor and it tasted like it was made with spoiled milk. I immediately assumed the recipe changed to make it “healthier” and went to google for answers. My question is still not answered but I was sad to see this flavor even has horrible reviews all over your very own website!! Hello! It’s time to change the recipe!

This particular flavor had chocolate chips rather then waxy bits and cookie dough was softer and more flavorful.
Fast forward to today I grabbed this product for my kids to have an ice cream night and it was everything BUT a treat. My 4yr old that I call the foodie tasted it and said he didn't want it. My 11 year old saud "" what made you get this"". I ate a spoon and threw the rest away.
Kids turned down ice cream this ice cream... That's a problem."

I usually buy whatever ice cream is on sale and last month Breyer's was on sale so we got the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. My family loved it and ate it within 2 days.

So I decided to go ahead and spend the extra few dollars and try a name brand. I was very disappointed. The ice cream tasted strange, like whiskey, and it had a foamy texture. My first thought was to check the expiration date. It wasn't expired and I hadn't left it out of the freezer. I only live a few minutes from the store I purchased it from. I would not buy this again and do not recommend it to others."

The actual ice cream tastes like milk or spoiled milk or something. It is truly disgusting. My roommate brought the cookies and cream flavor so it doesn't have anything to do with how our freezer was or the store's freezer because the other ice cream tasted significantly better. Like something I would actually spend money one. I personally don't have a car to drive back to the store to get a refund or I would've and Breyer's doesn't have a return policy or a ""satisfied or your money back""."
49_breyers,DisappointedPrego,2018-11-17,1,Tastes off,2,0,Can't put my fiunger on it but it just tastes strange. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Only ate a few spoonfuls and I am totally turned off. Gonna throw the rest away. The texture was also weird. Not thick and creamy. Best way I can describe it is almost spongy and foamy.
49_breyers,Brooke,2018-10-15,1,Weird Chemical Taste,2,0,We bought this and it was just so bad. We couldnt place the weird aftertaste that just overpowers everything. It tastes so chemically and is super unpleasant to eat. Expiration date is so far away too and it was brand new. Throwing it away and never getting again.
49_breyers,SammieJo,2018-08-27,1,Terrible,2,0,"As with other reviewers, the taste was just off. It almost tasted like it was spoiled and I couldn't take more than a few bites. I wasn't about to go return it to the store so it was thrown out. It was not out dated or even close to that. I'm very disappointed."

Unfortunately, the last couple times I've gotten cookie dough (my favorite), it's been disappointing. The most recent tub had a total of 5 chunks of cookie dough, and the whole batch had a strange, fake strawberry flavor to it. I let my wife try it before I said anything about it, and she independently said it tasted weird. Actually, I think the word she used was ""awful."" I'll be buying the off-brand from now on. It's much more affordable and the quality is so much better. Too bad."
49_breyers,Sad145,2017-12-21,1,Awful!,2,0,The worst ice cream I’ve eaten. It had a after taste and would melt very quickly. There was NO dough! I would not give this to a family member!!!

I recently bought Breyers cookie dough ice cream and the cookie dough was awful. Was like the dough had been freezer burnt and old and then added to the ice cream. It was not enjoyable at all. I threw the whole carton away. The cookie dough looked white like tablets. I’m going to explore different brands!"

Didn’t think too much when I grabbed it from the store’s freezer and the container was kinda squishy... Tossed it in the freezer for two hours and still came out squishy, meaning the ice cream is too soft (the texture I hate)... Ate a few spoonfuls and felt super disgusted I tossed entire tub into the garbage and vowed I will never purchase this brand ever again... gags"
49_breyers,Lizzy,2018-01-28,2,"Plenty of cookie dough, but not vanilla flavored!",1,0,Purchased some cookie dough today at Meijer for the kids. They said it tasted strange - I gave it a try and it is definitely not vanilla flavored. It tastes fruity - strawberry perhaps? Can't taste vanilla or cookie dough at all. We buy this occasionally and it has never tasted like this before. I'm wondering if we got a wonky batch.
49_breyers,Linda Lu,2020-04-28,1,Horrible taste,0,0,"I thought my freezer was broken because the chocolate chip cookie dough “ice cream” I was scooping was completely soft. That was my first clue. Then there was the taste, which was just awful. Tasted like chemicals to me. So, I look at the container again and it says very small at the bottom, “Frozen Dairy Dessert.” Not even ice cream! Then I look at the ingredients, and it has all of stuff in it that I don’t recognize. I always bought Breyers because of their natural ingredients. Please do better than this."

I just don't understand how it's even possible for it to tastes so bad."

I had been looking forward to it, and I am wondering if something was wrong with it or if it is just not good.

49_breyers,icecream4lyfe,2018-05-26,1,What happened?!,1,0,"I grew up eating Breyers and cookie dough was one of my favorite flavors. I bought some for the first time in years and oh my god, it was HORRIBLE. It tasted like it was made with spoiled milk and it had a weird aftertaste that reminded me of bananas. So disappointing."

Little did I know that things that are NOT ice cream hide out in the ice cream section of the freezer at the grocery store. I thought that this stuff was disgusting."
49_breyers,HitchHiker,2018-03-15,1,Made to taste spoiled,1,0,Ice cream taste like sour milk. Yet the best by date is in a year and three months! It taste pretty bad (to what ice cream is suppose to taste like) but I am mostly worried that it might actually be spoiled milk. Who knows.
49_breyers,Alimama4,2020-09-09,1,Why can’t your ice cream BE ice cream,0,0,"I am horrified to recently learn that despite being packaged the same not all of your flavors are “ice cream”. I guess kudos to your Marketing team bc I thought every time I bought your “ice cream” I was feeding my family a good ice cream. Sadly, cream isn’t even on the ingredient list and you use skim milk. It’s no wonder you have to add corn syrup, sugar and fructose. ALL of your products will stay at the store rather than come home to my family from now on. I only wish I had known sooner."
49_breyers,TweedleDee,2017-08-16,1,Really Disappointed,1,0,I've never had an issue with Breyers before but my most recent purchase had hardly ANY cookie dough in it. You might as well call this chocolate chip. Why am I paying $4-$5 for a product that cuts corners?
49_breyers,Mema3,2018-06-04,1,Something is wrong or recipe needs to be changed,1,0,I was highly disappointed in the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice cream. It was almost like snow cream and did not have a ice-cream smoothness. The taste wasn't good at all and not up to Breyers quality.
49_breyers,Jazzy143,2018-08-10,1,Weird taste,1,0,everyone says it taste sour but I wouldn’t say that. I just had a weird taste. I prefer publix brand of this flavor. All the other ice cream flavors for breyers are good except for this one.
49_breyers,DM22,2018-01-23,1,Very disappointed!,1,0,Tasted like cream. No sugar?!? I eat ice cream a lot! I would never turn down a bowl. Tonight I just couldn’t eat this fake tasting frozen cream. Yuk! Chocolate chip cookie dough.

The “cookie dough” pieces tasted disgusting, nothing like cookie dough at all and left the worst aftertaste. The overall ice cream was good but not with the cookie dough pieces. I picked them out and just ate the vanilla and chocolate chips. Very disappointed as I love the natural vanilla ice cream but will not be buying the cookie dough kind every again, will buy a different brand that actually taste good."

Also leaves a bad aftertaste. Please bring back the original cookie dough!"

Breyer's Oreo Non Dairy Ice Cream is the winner by far! As I am also allergic to Soy, this ice cream is perfect for me as it contains neither. I'm also a big fan of Oreo. Unlike a lot of other milk-free products, this ice cream tastes real and differs very little in flavor from regular ice cream! I will add, though, that my favorite ice cream before going dairy free was mint chocolate chip. Breyer's, if you released a mint chocolate chip flavor of this ice cream, I would be forever grateful."
50_breyers,Zaporha,2017-07-14,5,Hands Down Greatness,16,0,"Thank you Breyers for making non-dairy ice cream. Breyers has been my favorite brand of ice cream for years until I developed a dairy allergy, which didn't allow me to eat any ice cream. As of recent I am able to find non-dairy ice cream but the size are awful and pricey. Now I have options thanks to Breyers. My hope is that you will continue to make MORE flavors. I am not a cookies & cream kinda eater but this one is really good, its soft and the taste is typical Breyers. THANKS A BUNCH!! The price is I paid was decent, it's backed by the best ice cream brand, so I don't mind paying $6 for Breyers ice cream and it's over a pint."

Most non-dairy ice creams don't have the same texture as dairy ice cream, but texture of this almond milk ice cream is perfect.

I am lactose intolerant and also vegan so I feel as though I am an expert on non-dairy products. Most non-dairy ice creams taste strange or are just not worth eating. Breyer's non-dairy Oreo was the best I have ever tasted. It tastes just like real ice cream, is creamy, and delicious. This is now my go to ice cream. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to cut back on dairy but also it is great for anyone at all! My kids love it and they are very tough critics and eat dairy ice cream. Will be buying again!"

It’s better for your health and better for the animals! It’s also so great that you offer a normal size container. However I’m not a fan of this flavor, I really hope you can make the flavor more tasty so that people trying to be more health conscious wont be able to taste the difference. I am thinking it needs more of a creamy texture. Maybe adding peanut butter or using coconut milk would make it better. Anyway I really hope you can change the recipe slightly so that vegans, lactose intolerant people and normal diets will choose this option."

You can't tell the difference between almond milk and cow milk in this dessert and it's healthier for myself and the environment. My children had a bowl each and when they finished I asked them how was it? They both loved it and said they couldn't taste the difference, I regularly buy Breyers Oreo ice cream, favorite in our house. It would be great if there were more flavors to choose from, I will definitely buy Breyers non-dairy Oreo cookies and cream again. Looking forward to trying the vanilla peanut butter.

Bought a tub of this and a tub of your regular Oreo and forced all my family and friends to try it and about 50% guessed correctly! I challenge anyone to try to tell the difference- it's hard! (free advertisement idea, Breyers) It's fantastic to see Breyers expanding their products to encompass more dietary restrictions/choices.
Two suggestions when you decide to expand your selection:
1. something with a coconut/soy/oat base for people with nut allergies or who are wary of almonds' environmental footprint
2. Chocolate???? ;D"

We have a friend who's child has a dairy allergy and will definitely pick this up to have as an alternative option when she comes for a birthday party!"
50_breyers,Putney,2019-03-05,5,New and Exciting,1,1,"People that are not dairy free do not understand that almond milk is not something that is naturally creamy. If you can have real milk then do so and stop giving negative reviews for people who can't have real dairy. It's obviously not going to be super creamy... It's made with almonds. But that being said it's a good dessert. It has many potentials. Frozen dessert shakes, on the side with ice cream and much more. It's not sickning sweet and if you like it sweeter add some ice cream toppings :) I like the fact that it has Oreos in it . It could have some more. I'd like to see different flavors of the actual ice cream in the future like chocolate and cherries . Thank you for your effort. It gets annoying to have to make your own when your the only person that eats dairy free :) make more flavors dairy free please!! Chocolate Rocky road sounds good..."

I'm severely allergic to dairy so I was hesitant to buy it, but that's what EpiPen's are for lol. I had no reaction when I ate it, and it tastes just like the icecream I remember when I was little and had no allergies!!! I really appreciate Breyer's making this, I wish I could find the other flavor somewhere! It sounds really good! Maybe in the future if y'all make more flavors there could be a dedicated dairy free line in the factory :) I DO get the kind of greasy taste in my mouth that I saw someone talking about, but its really not bad."

I usually shy away from non dairy ice cream because I just don't think it will compare to the real stuff and that I'll inevitably be disappointed but this product really proved me wrong! I LOVE ice cream but unfortunately dairy doesn't always love me back quite as much and I think this might just be the solution to my dilemma! The ice cream tasted great, had a good creamy consistency and really tastes just like normal dairy ice cream but without any dairy side effects. The only difference I could decider was that it tasted a little lighter than some of the really rich dairy ice creams, but that wasn't really a negative. I think I've found my new go to treat!"

Love that they use real almond milk and really think they should start putting out more non-dairy flavors. What a great delicious treat for anyone! Wether you are just exploring other healthier food options or can not have dairy products Breyers non dairy is the perfect option!

I am vegetarian, not vegan, so I have no problem with regular ice cream. That being said, I am willing to try out healthier options. This is NOT one of them. This Breyers product tastes like freezer burn with Oreos in it. It's more like a milk slushie than ice cream. Another issue I have is the ingredient list. It contains lots of sugar in different forms, palm oil, corn syrup, along with lots of ingredients I cannot pronounce. This is not food. I'll stick to my regular brand that has four ingredients that are real food. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are on a non dairy diet and really crave something sort of like ice cream."
50_breyers,nolactoseplease,2018-02-25,1,not yum,0,1,"I was excited to see another non- lactose option from Breyers, but this was defective (I hope). What I thought was frost covering the package was actually leaking almond milk. The interior was shrunken such that the bottom was kind of hollow and as you can see there's a dark color around the edges of the ice almond milk. I gave it a taste in the middle not so great."
50_breyers,Highway2Health,2019-04-21,2,Need more non gmo and natural ingredients,0,0,"I think it’s great that breyers is offering more vegan options and I will applaud them for that. The ice cream wasn’t as good as other non dairy ice cream on the market and I really wish more companies would use more natural ingredients and non gmo food sources. Breyers peanut butter ice cream boasts about having non gmo ingredients so it goes to show that they are aware of it. It would be so awesome if they teamed up with Newman O’s or another brand of non gmo Oreo style cookie and send a message to Nabisco as well as other Monsanto affiliated corporations that natural ingredients matter. While I love the effort they put in by offering a non dairy version, I still feel that they can do better."

However, Mono & diglycerides are mostly sourced from animal fats and in this case it doesnt specify. Therefore, is it really vegan? High fructose corn syrup, soybean oil, soy lecithin, to name a few terrible ingredients. If ur a junk food vegan eating these ingredients, u may as well just eat the traditional stuff. Breyers makes a dairy ""natural"" vanilla without these terrible ingredients. Why cant they make them all like that, including the non dairy?.. ijs"

There are enough cookies, but it is very lacking in flavor! Not real sweet, but I don't taste any of the chocolate that I associate with Oreos, nor do I taste anything really at all but a mild sweetness. Not sure what it needs, but it definitely needs something to boost it and give it some flavor!"

50_breyers,Cgod,2017-08-21,1,Glad Breyer's is branching out but this is a flop,2,4,When I saw that Breyer's was coming out with a dairy free ice cream I knew that I had to try it. I'm very sad to say that this is the worst dairy free ice cream I've had (and I've had a lot of brands). This ice cream tastes like diet ice cream and you aren't even saving any calories eating it compared to other non dairy ice creams. Looking at the nutritional info the ice cream contains an average amount of fat and sugar compared to other non dairy ice creams so I'm not sure for its non satisfying taste.
50_breyers,Cindy,2017-07-15,4,Finally!!,1,0,"Finally someone figured out how to make a non-dairy ""ice cream"" that actually tastes good! I am dairy-free not by choice but because I am not able to tolerate any cow's milk products without severe discomfort. I have tried soy, coconut, almond, and rice milk products and found them lacking in taste, texture, or both. I had resigned myself to italian ices and sorbets then my mother found an article in the paper that mentioned Breyers Non-Dairy Cookies and Cream. I ran out to try it and am SO glad that I did! The texture is creamy and the almond taste is not overpowering like in other products I have tried. With the Oreo's, there is a nice crunch here and there as well. I wanted a strong chocolate flavor so I added a bit of syrup but this product can stand on its own. Thank you Breyers for making this!! I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to be dairy free."

I enjoyed the texture, still creamy despite being made with almond milk. The Oreo pieces are awesome, but I did find that the amount of sugar was a bit much - it kind of overpowered the taste of vanilla in the ice cream itself. Still, I'd gladly try the other flavors available."

Unfortunately, the taste was mediocre, and it left a greasy feeling on my lips and tongue. The ONLY redeeming factor was the Oreo pieces. I dug them out and left the “ice cream”. I will NOT be purchasing this item again."

You wouldn't even know this was non-dairy. Thank you for making this ice-cream!!! We are lookign forward to more non-dairy flavors from you! How about a nondairy classic Neopolitan?"

As someone who has tried a number of dairy-free alternatives over the years, I was excited to try this ice cream. Breyers has been a favorite treat since my childhood and I have long appreciated the natural ingredients. We often have dairy alternatives, not because anyone has a dairy allergy or intolerance, but to just balance out our nutrition. My 2 sons, mother and I all enjoyed this treat! The review was that it had excellent texture, substance and flavor! No one would have thought it was made with any thing other than milk! I think the box will last a grand total of 3 dessert nights. I think that sums up what we all thought of it! Thank you Breyers for this great main-stream dairy alternative! I would certainly buy this again."

In fact like the consistency that the almond milk gives the Oreo ice cream, more than the ""regular"" version.
It's light, and fluffy but still rich and decadent, I'm very impressed with Breyers! The price is on point as well, it's not nearly as expensive as other brands I've had in the past. OCD that wait to try to peanut butter one now!"

Some dairy free ice creams have a terrible texture or just taste... fake. This one did not. The price is a little high if you compare it to the price of Breyers dairy ice creams, but not that pricey if you compare it to other non-dairy ice creams. This is the best Oreo non-dairy ice cream I have tried."

The consistency is a little different than typical ice cream and that is what turned one of my children off. The taste is exactly the same as regular cookies and cream to me and I would defiantly recommend this to anyone.

I ask went and bought the Penut butter Almond milk ice-cream. I love it just as much!"
50_breyers,KJV0521,2018-06-01,5,Happy Pregnant Vegan,0,0,I am so happy that Breyers came out with vegan ice cream! You get more for your money and it's so good! Many vegan brands out there are overpriced and you only get a small amount. I haven't had dairy in a long time but this is pretty close to ice cream from what I remember! It doesn't have that off taste like I found with other brands. I highly recommend!
50_breyers,Ruby,2017-08-31,5,Awesome,0,0,This ice cream is amazing. My daughter has a milk allergy and it's no fun in the summer when all their friends come over at summer and eat regular ice cream.

50_breyers,mommamouse3,2018-01-09,2,Looks like ice cream but not even close,2,2,"I was excited to try this because I have a few friends and family who suffer from lactose intolerance. I always felt bad at our parties when serving ice cream or other dairy treats so I was hopeful this would be an option.
I first sent my daughter into the ShopRite to pick up a gallon of the Breyers Non Dairy Cookies and Cream. She came back out empty handed because she said they didn't have any which I thought was odd since there was a new campaign. Next time I went in and was able to find it. It wasn't with the rest of the Breyers ice cream but in a special case with I other non dairy products. Which is great if you're looking for it but most people wouldn't even know there was an option.
I brought the ice cream home and coincidentally my niece who has lactose intolerance was staying over. She has tried a few ice creams in search of a good tasting alternative because of her allergy. She thought it looked like ice cream but the texture was disappointing. The ice cream melted quickly and left a strong almond after taste. She likes almonds so she didn't mind. I really disliked it because of the almond after taste and would agree the texture was weird. Almost like ice milk. It wasn't thick enough for me at all. I really missed the creamy texture that dairy ice cream gives. Not even the yummy pieces of Oreo could mask the taste for me. She would buy it again even though she wouldn't consider ice cream. Definitely not for me but I would recommend it to someone with a lactose allergy who likes an almond taste."

The soy ice cream competition have figured out how to make it not melt funny, or lack of melting at all. Still it tastes good and the kids like it."

50_breyers,Momo,2017-09-12,4,Cookies and cream is not vegan,0,1,It may be dairy free but cookies and cream is not Vegan. Oreo cookies have whey which is a form of dairy. so the icecream maybe be dairy free but the cookies are not!

50_breyers,Abby,2019-03-14,5,I Converted...,0,0,"I am an ice cream addict! My children were both born with a milk protein intolerance (don't believe when a doctor says your baby is colicky). My son cried for 6 months before we finally received a proper diagnosis. I was nursing him at the time and didn't want to stop so I changed my diet and eliminated all milk protein. It was extremely hard for me to part with ice cream and cheese. I tried just about every non-dairy ice cream during that time. I didn't have much luck finding a replacement until my daughter was born over a year ago. I started to eliminate milk products in preparation for her birth since I was told the milk protein intolerance is normally genetic. I discovered this new product on the shelves and quickly got hooked. It is much creamier than alternatives and the oreo flavor is delicious. I'd love if you made a mint oreo, mint chocolate chip, or chocolate brownie version. I've gradually been introducing milk products back into my diet as my daughter is nursing less frequently. I've noticed that I feel better without them in my diet and actually prefer the lighter, almond milk products. I've been trying to stock back up on this item, but my local stores haven't had it on the shelves even though the store locator says they should. Hopefully I find a store that carries it again soon and I'll get ice cream back out of my life for good (never thought I'd say those words)!"
51_breyers,Bill,2018-07-10,1,Why did you change the recipe?,52,5,"Breyers coffee ice cream and Breyers in general has been one of my favorites for many, many years so I was extremely disappointed when I tasted this new version. What happened to using only simple, all natural ingredients like milk, cream and sugar? Now it contains things like mono and diglycerides, vegetable gums, and polysorbate 80. I noticed a different mouth feel right away. Oily and disgusting. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing this brand any longer. Sad."
51_breyers,Patrick,2018-02-09,1,Terrible!!!,41,5,"Growing up, I used to love your coffee ice cream. It has consistently been one of my favorite flavors. But the carton I just bought is going straight in the trash. This new recipe isn’t bolder; it’s bitter!
I can’t begin to tell you how disappointed I am. It’s like a childhood friend has passed away. I won’t be buying your ice cream again until I see the old recipe returned. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!"
51_breyers,Rach,2019-01-15,1,Disgusting Unnatural,20,4,"Growing up, Breyer’s was the only brand of ice cream family ate. Coffee was a favorite for both myself and my mother. I decided to track down a carton yesterday, I opened it and on the first taste I was absolutely disgusted, it tasted like chemicals. I had to check to see if I’d purchased the wrong brand... no. Then I checked the ingredients and of course, no longer the traditional recipe is used. Corn syrup is the second ingredient! Xanthan gum?!? When I was growing up Breyer’s prided itself on natural, simple ingredients (I remember the commercial from the 90s stating only natural ingredients you can pronounce). I threw the carton in the trash and went for Haagen Daz, which satisfied my craving. I will never purchase Breyer’s again. In the age of organic and natural Breyer’s is a major fail."
51_breyers,Queuetip,2017-10-15,1,Terrible,30,3,Bring back Coffee Ice Cream. This Frozen dairy dessert is not fit for my dog. I loved your coffee ice cream. it was perfect but I cant stand this poor replacement. Yuck.
51_breyers,customer,2018-05-28,1,Worst Coffee Ice Cream Ever,25,5,"This is by far the worst tasting coffee flavored ice cream I've ever had. I love dark roast coffee and drink primarily Colombian roast daily. I expected a coffee taste but also expected it to be sweet after all it is ice cream. But this ""ice cream"" I leaves a burnt coffee after taste in my mouth. Why did you make this coffee ice cream so incredibly bitter? This is not ice cream."
51_breyers,Headache Sufferer,2018-05-03,5,A scoop every night!,2,1,"This ice cream is delicious for people who love cream/milk with their coffee. More importantly for me, a website on migraine headaches recommended eating a scoop of coffee ice cream every night before going to bed to reduce morning migraines - and oddly enough, it has been helping me! Breyers is the only ""pure"" ice cream I could find without other additives, specifically without carrageenan , which is a known migraine contributor. Unfortunately my local supermarkets are not carrying it now so I must start looking for some other brand, which I already know will be difficult."
51_breyers,Lisa60,2019-05-04,1,Breyers Coffee Ice Cream is no longer worth eating,3,3,"I hadn't treated myself to ice cream recently, but bought some today and looked forward to enjoying it. I was sadly disappointed to find this product is nothing like the product I previously loved. Breyers Coffee flavored ice cream used to be my favorite, but that ended today. The product is light and fluffy, full of air, and not the creamy rich delicious flavorful product it used to be. This is a poor substitute for ice cream, and the last time I will ever purchase Breyers. BTW, this is an honest review, and I am not looking for any coupons for free product - I won't be taking any of this home again even if it is free. If you've pleased other customers with this change, well then good, but you've lost at least one customer."
51_breyers,Chee Chee,2017-07-26,5,favorite,16,6,This is my grandmother's favorite brand and flavor. Unfortunately since she was diagnose with diabetes she can no longer enjoy it. Maybe in the future you could consider making a sugar free coffee ice cream.
51_breyers,Beema412,2019-11-19,1,Not very good,1,2,"I am a new coffee flavored ice cream eater. I like it so much that it has almost replaced my old stand by which is chocolate. I recent became addicted to 2 of your competitors coffee ice cream but as it is not on sale at the moment I opted to try Breyers thinking it would be just as good. NOPE! I was so wrong. This has no coffee flavor at all. Texture wise it's fine but it really needs more flavor. Also it is not ice cream, It's frozen dairy dessert. That is my fault for not reading the label well. I will try to finish what I purchased but I won't buy another quart sadly."
51_breyers,Starson,2018-03-26,2,What happened???,11,5,Has this coffee ice cream recipe changed? I remember it being very different and much better. Now it's more like a soft ice cream instead of real ice cream that stays hard in the freezer. Please bring back the old recipe!!!

51_breyers,Carlie,2019-04-15,4,Love it!,2,0,"Not sure why everyone is hating on the coffee flavour. It’s different, light, fresh and way less bloating than the original recipe.

51_breyers,Dutchman,2018-01-27,1,Not ice cream.,7,4,"Very little taste. Not ice cream. but frozen dairy dessert. Very little taste. I used to trust Breyers but this is not even close to ice cream. Leaves an after taste and I will not buy your ""frozen dairy dessert"" again."

51_breyers,Tennessean,2017-12-14,5,Love it!,3,1,"I've had this a couple times now and it is excellent. There are a handful of reviews complaining that it is not as good as the old recipe, but since I didn't try the old recipe, I cannot compare. However, without the comparison, it tastes great."

I was pleasantly surprised to see the coffee ice cream only has 100 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving. Best part is, it's delicious!!

51_breyers,No Name,2019-01-16,5,Great taste!,3,1,The coffee ice cream is my absolute favorite as creamy taste is fabulous! Nobody makes a better coffee!
51_breyers,Skyppy,2018-10-27,1,Would never buy again,2,3,I have gotten Breyers coffee ice cream in the past and I don’t remember it tasting this bad. I thought I may have had an expired container but no. This tastes like instant coffee ice cream. I couldn’t eat it and threw out the rest which is something I never have done with any ice cream. By far the worst. I’m very surprised since breyers typical had good tasting ice cream. Maybe the workers where sleeping when they made this batch.

I guess kudos to your Marketing team bc I thought every time I bought your “ice cream” I was feeding my family a good ice cream. Sadly, cream isn’t even on the ingredient list and you use skim milk. It’s no wonder you have to add corn syrup, sugar and fructose. ALL of your products will stay at the store rather than come home to my family from now on. I only wish I had known sooner."

I thought I was safe picking a plain coffee flavor. The moment I tasted it, I knew something was off. It has an unnatural texture and the new “deep Colombian” flavor is bitter. I looked more closely at the package and found that this is not ice cream, it’s “frozen dairy dessert”. I wish I could get my money back."

52_breyers,kelseyb119,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"This ice cream is pretty “clean” in terms of the ingredients and you can taste the difference! Both the vanilla and the chocolate have a strong pure flavor, delicious but not too sugary. They are creamy. The vanilla has some depth, and the chocolate has a nice rich flavor. This is high quality ice cream at a lower price point than some of the other brands with a similar focus on cleaner ingredients (like Haagen Dazs). I like this particular carton because you get two flavors at once, and you can sort of “choose your own adventure” when you eat it! You could use a scoop of all vanilla one day for pie ala mode, a scoop of all chocolate for a decadent snack, or a “twist” of both flavors."

52_breyers,csachb,2020-09-21,3,,0,0,I first started eating this brand a little over 20 years ago and The Taste and ingredients were quite different at that time. It was a smooth and simple recipe. It only contained three to five ingredients and The Taste which is much better than. Something has changed through the years and the ice cream isn't as smooth. It has a forced creaminess to the consistency now and they've begun and a ton of ingredients that can no longer be pronounced.
52_breyers,rhiggins918,2020-09-22,5,,0,0,Our family favorite ice cream. This is REAL ice cream at a reasonable price. You can taste the difference from all of those other “frozen treats” that can’t even legally call themselves ice cream because of all of the unnatural ingredients they put in their products. My family isn’t a huge fan of strawberry so we usually go for the chocolate and vanilla but if this isn’t available we buy whatever breyers is available.
52_breyers,yohannaw267d,2020-09-22,5,,0,0,Breyers ice cream is just naturally creamy and feels very homemade. I absolutely love it because I feel like I just went to Dairy Queen or a place like Brusters and got premium ice cream at home. I did get the mixture because the mixture taste better to me because I like to mix my ice cream but it just depends on the person I guess. I highly recommend that if you’ve never had breyers ice cream to try it.￼

I was hoping it would be creamier, but I was actually disappointed. It tastes just ok. I wish the vanilla had vanilla beans in it, and the chocolate didn’t really have a strong flavor either. As far as ice creams go, this one wasn’t my favorite."

Yes, I've seen the commercials and read the ingredient list, so I know it's all natural ingredients, but it's just ok. It gets the job done. It's a little too hard for me, not creamy enough for me. I do have to say the straight forward chocolate or vanilla is go."

52_breyers,msaxd,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,This is the best of both worlds! I love chocolate and vanilla together so this is a God send! The vanilla is light and authentic tasting while the chocolate is strong but curbed when eaten with the vanilla. This is a great way to get two flavors without buying two quarts of ice cream.

52_breyers,laurag122,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,Brewers vanilla ice cream is by far the best and most delicious vanilla there is. The combo of vanilla and chocolate makes for a great split of tastes. The vanilla is made with real vanilla bean and you can not only taste but see it.
52_breyers,slimone,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"Perfect for all ice cream lovers. All natural vanilla, where you really taste vanilla bean. All natural chocolate, smooth and delicious. Better than newer companies that aren’t natural and taste like fake milk. This is the real deal."

It was my favorite years ago. Then, it had a dry texture for a while, so I stopped buying it. I decided to try it recently, but it has changed again. The main ingredient is skim milk, then corn syrup, sugar, fructose... then cream. The ice cream has a strange flavor, as if another flavor was mixed in. What happened to the good old fashioned vanilla ice cream?? The carton doesn’t even say “ice cream” on it, it says “frozen dairy dessert.” I am very disappointed and will never buy this product again!"

I could probably finish the whole quart in one sitting, HOWEVER, this flavor does have one major flaw. Those obtrusive chocolate chips are too frozen solid to be enjoyed! At first I am appreciating the raspberry, but as soon as I begin biting a bit with my molars it feels like I am grinding tiny bricks that I have to break up. Breyers, if you are reading this, please make a few batches of this without the chocolate. I will single handedly bring in enough gross sales to support its production"

My only problem now is that it was on sale at my store this week and they didn’t have this flavor.

Fast forward about a decade. One day I discovered that Breyer's came out with a Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip ice cream! That was an amazing day. It wasn't the same as homemade, but it sure was a lot easier! And that flavor is super-hard to find!!
Fast forward to today. I bought a box of the black raspberry ice cream, as I quite enjoy the flavor, but I didn't realize that Breyer's had completely changed the recipe, and it doesn't even qualify as ice cream anymore! After I opened the box, I saw the ice cream looked white (trust me, black raspberries stain dark pink!), which was a shock. Then I saw that it was labeled ""Frozen Dairy Dessert."" There aren't any REAL black raspberries left in the ingredient list. Just flavoring. I was heartily disappointed. I could tell the quality of Breyer's ice cream was slowly decreasing over time, but this was quite a blow. If you love black raspberries, look elsewhere for a satisfying ice cream."

56_breyers,Vivv,2019-06-22,5,Chocoholic’s Dream,1,0,"I’m not a huge ice cream fan. But this flavor is so exceptionally delicious that the exact right superlative doesn’t exist. Sounds hyperbolic but it is the basic truth. If you LOVE chocolate, insist that your chocolate have a rich dense flavor that awakens every tastebud in your mouth, then you can’t go wrong with this ice cream flavor.
I’ve seen other reviews that complained of hit or miss quality and I have to say I’ve never had a bad batch. Of course I wish there were more truffles, but I’ve never felt like I got ripped off or cheated."

It was merely chocolate ice cream. Poor quality control. Now I doubt I'll ever trust Breyers again, not knowing if what is advertised is indeed what is included."

I can't stand ice cream that is too sweet. This is just right. The contrast between the smoothness of the ice cream and the hard but velvety texture of the truffles is exquisite."

My only suggestion would be to increase the truffles but I really like my chocolate to be overloaded."
56_breyers,gormay,2018-09-14,1,Disappointing,0,4,"Breyers, you can do better! The ice cream itself was good. The truffles in it were dreadful! They tasted like plastic, and the ingredients list seemed to indicate that they were made of gums and other unnatural stuff. No wonder you called them ""chocolately"" truffles."

56_breyers,Chocolove,2020-04-09,5,For chocolate lovers,0,0,The flavor of this ice cream is similar to the ghiradelli dark chocolate ice cream I’ve bought from a local shop near where I live. i am not a fan of the little chocolates inside the ice cream but the ice cream is phenomenal.
56_breyers,Gloria1223,2020-08-21,5,Lots of truffles in this ice cream!,0,0,"Best new ice cream! After initial purchase, I’ve bought it twice more. Still creamy but the truffles add an additional interest. Not overly sweet because the truffles are dark chocolate. ❤️❤️"

57_breyers,rookie,2017-10-14,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!,4,0,This is undoubtedly the best ice cream I have ever had. I was hesitant to try salted caramel ice cream because I do not like salt. I love caramel though. Breyers happened to be the first I tried. I have tried others but always came back to Breyers. Now I don't have anything but (and it doesn't hurt that it is lower in calories and fat than most other ice creams).
57_breyers,JaJo83,2020-09-29,1,Bought twice - No caramel swirl at all,0,0,"I bought this at Drug Mart a few weeks ago, and I was really excited about the salted caramel swirl. It's probably my favorite dessert flavor. I was sad to find there was not one drop of caramel in the carton I got. I assumed it was a fluke, so I tried again. To my surprise, no caramel again. I think y'all had a glitch with the machine that adds caramel. Have you had complaints? Is there any way I can get this with caramel swirl?"
57_breyers,Mouse,2017-11-15,5,Best Flavor of All - Only 2 Saturated Fats,5,0,I watch my saturated fats and I avoid whey. This good tasting ice cream has only 2 Sats and no whey. Great product.
57_breyers,Iya1,2017-10-02,4,Amazing ice cream,4,2,I love this ice cream. My only problem with it is that there are small rubber pieces mixed in. I've tried several cartons and it is in every single one.
57_breyers,Icecreamnerd,2018-05-17,3,Was okay,1,0,"I liked it....but not enough to buy again. I wanted more of a ""ribbon"" of caramel. Plus, I actually like more of a sea salt taste....this was not enough of that. It was creamy, but just didn't completely satisfy my ice cream craving."
57_breyers,Bhrat,2019-06-09,5,"Best no-sugar ice cream I""ve had",0,0,"I've tried several ""diet"" and no-sugar ice creams and hated most. The CarbSmart is lots lower in carbs but the consistency and taste just don't do it. While I agree with the review that I would have preferred it to have a ribbon of the caramel and slightly more salty taste, all in all it's great. I'll definitely buy it again and just account for the day's carbs. Good product."
57_breyers,FunkyD,2017-08-07,2,Too salty flavor,1,1,Tried it once - Waaay too much salt flavor - the No sugar added Salted Caramel is MUCH better!!! Won't eat this again.
57_breyers,Dasc00,2017-10-24,1,Seems attificial,0,1,"The carton does not indicate this is ice cream , but rather a dairy treat. It is very creamy to the point of being artificial. The caramel which appears to be ribbons, is not. Overall, I am not fond of this dessert product. It is gluten free and not true ice cream. Will be requesting a refund."

57_breyers,Melliebholl,2017-10-01,5,Soft texture,0,0,I loved it. The flavor was delicious and the soft texture and consistency was perfect. It's great in a milkshake with bananas or peanut butter.
57_breyers,Rbrack,2019-02-11,5,The Best Salted Caramel Icecream,0,0,Every other brand of salted caramel icecream I've tried has been way too sweet. This one strikes the perfect balance between salty and sweet.

It was a night mare from the beginning, they forgot to make it, decorated it terribly (they were apologetic teenagers and didn't want to make them feel bad) and there was barely any ice cream in the cake. The lack of actual ice cream was almost mind blowing. All this goes without saying if I had known this ice cream flavor existed I would have bought a few and wrote happy birthday on the top. It tastes better, and has a legitimate ice cream cake flavor we were hoping for not all the cake you can see below!"

THE FLAVORS ARE EXACTLY LIKE CARVEL'S ICE CREAM CAKES, right down to chocolate crumble. I've always enjoyed Breyers ice cream, but this flavor takes...the cake. By far. Over any other ice cream brand, and other Breyers flavors themselves. A must have in any freezer! The only point of feedback I have is that the proportion of chocolate crumble to vanilla could be shifted from 1:3 to 1:2."
58_breyers,Diener13,2017-07-23,5,New obsession!,12,0,I am absolutely in LOVE with the chocolate crunchy center! I've bought this flavor over and over again the past few weeks. Obsessed!!! I wish I could eat this flavor for the rest of my life!
58_breyers,Corrierit,2020-01-07,2,No Chocolate Crunchies,2,0,My ice cream cake container contained zero crunchies my kids were very disappointed. I had to try ice cream without crunchies and yes it was very disappointing. I will be calling in a complaint tomorrow. Ugh!
58_breyers,Lauren1,2017-09-03,1,No crunch,7,1,This flavor claims to have chocolate crunch but the crunch is missing! My container was just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Very disappointed.
58_breyers,Bursting Disapointment,2020-02-11,1,Breyers Bait & Switch Ice Cream Cake,0,0,"I recently purchased Breyer’s Ice Cream Cake flavored ice cream from a neighborhood grocery store and was very disappointed to find it was simply vanilla ice cream with a thin chocolate stripe. The Breyer’s web site describes the product as “bursting with loads of chocolatey crunches"" but, as you can see from the attached photos that was not the case.
I understand that it’s common practice to use Photoshop to make the product look appetizing, even festive, per the celebratory confetti pictured on the carton. Clearly I wasn’t expecting the ice cream to be bursting with confetti but I was expecting it to be “bursting with loads of chocolatey crunchies” of which there were none.
I’m somewhat reluctant to purchase any other flavors as I don’t want to disappoint the kids again with another bait and switch Breyers product and I can see from the reviews this has been a problem for two years."

I love love Ice cream and have tried many different Brands and Flavors and so far it is my Favorite! It is Amazing The only thing I would like better about it is if there was more of the Chocolate part with the crunchies! Instead of it being just a small strip in the middle it would be great if it was like half and half. That would be the only thing I would change about it and that is only because it is so so good I want more of it! Maybe they could just make a new Flavor and it would be called ""Chocolate Crunchies"" That would be Fantastic! But Thank you Breyers for making my so far Favorite Ice cream! Thanks Cheri Jankowski"
58_breyers,Georgia,2017-08-28,2,NO CRUNCHIES?!,2,0,"I bought this flavor over others, including other brands because it says there are chocolate crunchies in here like ice cream cake has, easily the best part of ice cream cake! Was on special at my grocer so I purchased. I opened this and no crunchies are inside the chocolate ice cream section whatsoever. I dug deeper thinking maybe they were just buried but none were found. Can I get a refund please??"

58_breyers,Jenn85,2019-05-29,3,Ice cream cake,0,0,My usual flavor is Natural vanilla but I tried this instead. The overall flavor is good but the chocolate portion is TOO SMALL vs the vanilla/chocolate ratio. Please add more chocolate with crunchies. I also buy the vanilla/chocolate/strawberry which I love. Thanks
58_breyers,M411,2017-10-02,5,One of my new favorite flavors,2,0,"This flavor has become one of my family's favorite flavors. I have to agree with others who feel that they should add more chocolate with cookie pieces by making it either half vanilla and half chocolate or by making a flavor that is just the chocolate with cookie pieces in it. Either way, there needs to be more of the chocolate with the cookie pieces."
58_breyers,Eve2020,2020-04-02,4,No crunch!!,0,0,This ice cream isn’t bad at all and it will did the job if u have the taste for ice cream cake but it is lacking the crunch. It’s mainly chocolate ice cream in the middle with hardly any crunch what so ever!! Please add more crunch

The chocolate center with those delectable crunchies is amazing. I could eat a bowl of nothing but the chocolate center. How about all chocolate with the crunchies with fudge ribbons and a few thin rows of vanilla. Anyway, this is in my top three favorite flavors. Top two actually!"
58_breyers,kgro,2018-02-13,4,New Favorite!,2,0,"I recently stumbled across this flavor at my grocery store the other day and was super excited to try this. Glad to say it didn’t disappoint. I wish there was a little more chocolate ice cream and it could use more of the crunchies but overall still a very good flavor. To whoever came up with this idea, you deserve a raise."
58_breyers,Madmike,2017-09-06,1,Dissappointed not one crunchie,4,1,I was very disappointed! flavors were ok but have better varieties of this old favorite from other brands. Not one cruchie in mine one of four family members had a small amount will stick with our Breyers favorites we have many.

58_breyers,ashleyb01,2017-09-21,5,"Loved it, so addicting!",2,0,My favorite part about this flavor is the chocolate with the crunchy pieces in it. Then there is the vanilla on the outsides to create a balance. This is y new favorite ice cream and i can not stop eating it.
58_breyers,juji,2018-09-16,5,More of the chocolate part!,2,0,Suggestion to a perfect ice cream: add more of the chocolate ice cream and cookie section. Sometimes the chocolate part is smaller than other times.
58_breyers,Kimbo79,2018-05-17,5,OMG Delicious,1,0,This ice cream tastes just like a carvel or friendly’s ice cream cake from my childhood!! It is sooo delicious!! I can’t get enough. I would love to see this become a half vanilla and half chocolate with crunchies but will take it just as it is as well! Never stop making it. Sell at more stores!!

But what a surprise, the vanilla,chocolate and crunchies are fantastic. I buy this every time I buy ice cream."
58_breyers,Black Angel,2019-04-19,2,Malfunction,1,0,My ice cream was all chocolate on top and vanilla in the bottom. The first box I was pleased my container was identical to the Box picture. The taste was good just wish I had the crunch in the middle. Can you send me a coupon ? I appreciate it.
58_breyers,ReRe,2019-02-11,5,More Crunchies Please!!!!,0,0,"This ice cream is delicious! My wife doesn't really like chocolate ice cream, however when she tasted this one, she and I were fighting over the one small area of chocolate ice cream with the crunchies. So my suggestion, please add more chocolate with the chocolate crunchies. I suggest half should be Vanilla and the other half should be Chocolate with the crunchies, because if it is not fixed, you could potentially be the reason for discourse in the household. Please fix this!! Thanks!!"
58_breyers,Fina,2017-09-08,1,No Crunchies!!!!!,2,1,I bought this and was so excited to eat it. When I opened it there were no Chunchies and the chocolate looked so light. I was worried that something was defiantly wrong with the batch.
58_breyers,Lala302,2017-12-09,5,Awesome,1,0,Delicious not too much but perfect. Crunchie cookie like Ice cream cake all in the middle where the chocolate is. Then the basic vanilla is surrounded on each side its perfect

58_breyers,Moose82,2017-09-30,4,Why so stingy with the chocolate center?,0,0,This ice cream is amazing!! But they put way too much vanilla and the chocolate is so Good!!! Me and my hubby always fight about the taking all the chocolate lol!! They really need to do half and half or like someone else suggested make the chocolate it's own flavor!! Super yummy though!! I put up with the over abundance of vanilla and I will buy 3 or 4 at a time because they only sell it at one store near me!! Lol
58_breyers,Purple,2019-06-25,4,More Chocolate,0,0,My family and I love the birthday cake ice cream. We are chocolate lovers and we hope you will consider in making just all chocolate cake. We would love to have more of the chocolate. Consider two side chocolate cake and vanilla in the middle #chocolatelovers #breyerschocolatecake. I choose good because it will be excellent if it was more chocolate
58_breyers,Alexisnicky,2018-04-01,5,Amazing! But I want more!,0,0,"This is my absolute favorite flavor, I stopped buying the other flavors and get these 2-4 at a time! The chocolate with the crunches are the best part and I want more of it, either make it half and half or sell the chocolate with crunches alone. The chocolate with the crunches puts me in a happy place every time I have it and need more of it!"
58_breyers,BringBackTheCrunchies,2019-10-06,1,Where are the Crunchies?!,0,0,"Normally this is one of my family's favorite flavors, but the last container we opened did not have a single ""chocolatey crunchy""!! The crunchies are THE best part, and basically the only reason to buy this ice cream...otherwise is just chocolate & vanilla ice cream. Very disappointed."
58_breyers,AlinTampa,2020-04-22,4,almost great,0,0,The amount of chocolate crunchies need to be increased and put in both the vanilla and chocolate icecream not just the chocolate. The ratio of vanilla icecream to chocolate icecream is about 2:1 so there is inherently less chocolate crunchies. Change this up and you have a real winner
58_breyers,Jules,2017-08-10,5,So yummy!!,0,0,This flavor is the best!!! I am not a chocolate lover but love this! Looking for a box with just the chocolate center flavor without the vanilla ice cream. This flavor goes fast in our house! Please keep his flavor and come up with the chocolate flavor by itself.

The ice cream looked nothing like the picture. It was completely brown not a vanilla with fudge. Second, it tasted so artificially coconut that I literally spit ii out.

I decided to try this one day because it looked similar to my local ice cream parlor's ""Buckeye"" flavor. Well I was not disappointed! However, I am disappointed in myself for letting my kids try it, all three of them love it too. I really hope this flavor will be available for years to come we love it that much. The peanut butter is so creamy, it blends so well with the chocolate. Two favorite flavors masterfully combined. Thank you Breyers!"
60_breyers,Pete,2017-11-06,1,Where's all the peanut butter?,8,10,I Bought this flavor this evening and was very excited to try it. Unfortunatly I'm very disappointed. I found the chocolate to be too dark and rich and hardly any peanut butter in the ice cream. I found it so bad I'm tempted to call brewers or return it to the grocery store. I'm not really sure what I'll do since it's a small amount of $ to worry about but I was truly looking forward to this flavor. I even let my wife try it and she said the same exact thing. Fyi prior to this we have been getting a competors chocolate peanut butter ice cream and it by far blows this one away in flavor and peanut butter amounts in it. I will stick with that brand and enjoy my ice cream.
60_breyers,enchilada72,2018-03-18,5,Best ice cream!,4,0,"This ice cream is delicious. It is a rich and creamy dark chocolate with a salty, slightly crispy ribbon of peanut butter. The combination is perfect. I always say I will try a new flavor on any given week. The second I see this flavor I say ""I'll try something new next week"", and grab this one. The peanut butter is not an overly sweet and creamy peanut butter. It is the real thing with the salty favor. Just a perfect combination. This is my guilty pleasure and I enjoy every bite!"
60_breyers,Maddie,2019-03-14,2,"Good the first time, not the second",4,0,"I got this ice cream from the grocery store and really liked the flavor and the amount of peanut butter in it, so I bought a second carton when the first was gone. To my surprise, the second carton of ice cream had no peanut butter in it at all! It was labeled chocolate peanut butter, but contained no peanut butter whatsoever. it just felt like I was eating plain chocolate ice cream. Breyers really needs to make sure their batches are consistant."

Over the last three to four months though, I've noticed a huge change. Barely any peanut butter has been in the last 6 cartons we have purchased (all over about a 3 - 4 month period). I'm talking less than a teaspoon of peanut butter per whole container (if even that). Basically it is just chocolate now ice cream now. I thought it was just a fluke but it has been like this the last 6 cartons (all bought during different weeks). It used to be so good. Wish they had not changed the recipe."
60_breyers,Kakyko,2017-10-17,4,What Happened to The Peanut Butter,2,0,"This quickly became mine and my husbands favorite ice cream! However the last two gallons we purchased had no peanut butter in them very sad. Hoping you didn’t change the recipe to include less peanut butter because it was perfect before. Maybe it was a bad batch, but if it wasn’t my recommendation would be to change it back, I look forward to trying again later to see if it’s yummy again!"

You got it right! I've had some of your other Penut Butter 'flavors' and found them to be artificial - not a good taste. However, this one is awesome. No artificial Penut Butter flavors, texture was creamy, chocolate ice cream tasted great. Please keep making this one.
Of course, more or chunky Penut Butter would be even better.
Cheers"

I was excited to see that my favorite store now had my favorite flavor in my favorite brand! Long story short, I bought the last 2 cartons in the freezer and I guess that I might as well have just bought plain chocolate because I have yet to find any peanut butter!
Very dissatisfied and feel ripped off."

60_breyers,kaos,2018-01-28,1,They don't understand...,1,1,"The chocolate ice cream has to be done right. Not so sweet. And every real peanut butter lovers exquisite experience is to find huge chunks of peanut butter. Not ripply thin ribbons of peanut butter in overly sweet chocolate ice cream. It just makes chocolate/peanut butter flavor ice cream, and not the couple spoons of awesome chocolate ice cream, followed by a huge frozen peanut butter chunk sublimeness...Big difference.So disappointing because I think Breyers could do a better one if they wanted to."
60_breyers,CaliScoop,2020-09-04,5,Best Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream,1,0,Breyers outdid itself with both the richness of the chocolate ice cream. It is a dark and flavorful chocolate that compliments the perfect amount of added creamy peanut butter. I cannot think of how to make this flavor any better. I have been making chocolate peanut butter ice cream for years because there was good commercial alternative. Breyere is now ny new favorite!
60_breyers,Icey1,2020-04-02,3,Where's the peanut butter?,0,0,"Mayber there was a batch run without peanut butter? My favorite brand was out due to the COVID panic shopping and this was the only peanut butter option. On the box is looks like there should be some but inside have only encountered maybe a flake here or there, not even quite positive that was the peanut butter part.
I'm being generous in the stars, because I suppose the chocolate is ok, though I never buy just chocolate intentionally myself.
Really hoping there is a recall or something because it doesn't seem right."

Highly recommended please please try it
60_breyers,marianam18,2020-03-16,5,,0,0,Breyers is an extremely affordable and easy brand to find. They are very well known for theyre delicious ice cream flavors and the smoothness of the ice cream. I myself am not a very big fan of peanut butter and chocolate but this ice cream is a perfect ratio of each. The peanut butter and chocolate compliment each other and do not confuse the taste buds. Breyers is definitely a great treat to have in the summer or all year round.
60_breyers,FunkyD,2017-08-07,3,Ok ice cream,2,3,Tried it once - not impressed. What I got was Dark Chocolate. After a few days in our freezer(after I had eaten some) the chocolate turned Really dark & was Not good any more. Dumped the rest.
60_breyers,Tugboat13,2018-07-29,5,Help! Getting hard to find our favorite flavor,0,0,"Sooooo good but hard to find in this dark chocolate with peanut swirl. Not with Reese’s pices or peanut cup chunks, just chocolate with peanut butter swirl. My neighborhood Walmart carries it but I notice the supply seems to getting smaller and smaller, which sometimes indicates an upcoming discontinuance. I hope not, our whole family loves it much more than the ones with Reese’s pieces or Reese’s peanut butter chunk. Those are tasty but harder to eat because the pieces and. Chunks get much harder when frozen, making it difficult for some little ones with baby teeth or those who must wear dentures. The swirl is perfect...please don’t discontinue and if only Walmart is discontinuing, please let us know of any other supermarkets in the central Florida area carry it. When I can’t get it, I get the sad, puppy dog eyes...and for those reading this, yes we are incredibly spoiled!!!"
60_breyers,A mom,2019-07-08,5,So delicious,0,0,"The chocolate is so rich and creamy. It is very smooth in my mouth. The peanut butter is also rich and smooth but not over powering the taste. It also gives a slight salty taste to it. To me, a hint of saltiness provides another dimension of flavors. Chocolate and peanut butter integrated very well. It definitely a classic ice cream flavor, well done Breyer's!"
60_breyers,Nunya,2019-01-25,1,No exaggeration. Zero peanut butter.,0,0,"So I am eating this from the carton. I'm about 1/3 way down and waiting for the peanut butter. I pull all the ice cream out and chop it up and there isn't a single ribbon or piece of peanut butter in the entire carton. No exaggeration, there is zero peanut butter. I bought dark chocolate ice cream, unintentionally. I won't be buying again. What a rip off."

60_breyers,jennyi2,2020-01-07,5,,0,0,Who doesn't love ice cream?! I know I do. I love chocolate and peanut butter as well so this ice cream has everything. It's creamy and flavorful. It doesn't have a grainy texture and is made with real ingredients. It doesn't have an artificial flavor and is very affordable. It makes for a perfect occasional treat!
60_breyers,sydneyw30,2019-10-10,5,,0,0,There is a perfect balance of all of the flavors...neither overpowers the other. Its creamy and delicious! I wish I could find a bigger container. I used to buy bigger brand ice creams and then found Breyers had bigger containers that also happened to be cheaper. I will definitely be using this brand from now on.
60_breyers,suddenlys,2020-07-09,5,,0,0,"Breyers makes the best ice cream out there. What makes their products stands out is their quality consistency. They never disappoint, their ice cream is smooth and has a rich taste that keeps me wanting for more. This peanut butter ice cream tub lasted for three days because my kids and hubby loves it so much!"
60_breyers,tarahd4,2020-02-10,4,,0,0,I am a sucker for anything with chocolate and peanut butter. This stuff is just so good. Me and my boyfriend will buy it for movie nights and eat it together. Is it bad to say I could probably eat the whole thing to myself lol. But I would definitely recommend trying if you love peanut butter and chocolate.

60_breyers,Zenxbeatbox,2018-09-05,5,Peanut butter!,0,0,2018 perfect. Lots of Peanut Butter with rich Chocolate and not the light chocolate either. It needs to be the rich heavy chocolate or its not strong enough! Its already got alot of peanut butter but I would love to see you guys do a 25% extra peanut butter!!! :) I buy a half gallon a week haha :)
60_breyers,juliad87,2020-06-01,2,,0,0,"Although I love chocolate peanut butter and Breyers ice cream, the two mixed together seem like another generic combination. There was no enthusiasm to complement the chocolate bar flavour with it's own unique ice cream so it felt as though it was just the same as another generic ice cream."

60_breyers,vauntyarchangel,2020-01-05,3,,0,0,I had high hopes for this ice cream but I was disappointed. If you really like peanut butter this may be an ice cream for you but I am not a big fan.

61_breyers,JMJILYSS,2019-07-28,5,A necessity in the freezer!!,0,0,Vanilla (only) ice cream cups are the absolute perfect size for serving company (and family!!) a portion on top of things like cobblers and pies. In the middle of winter---a good hot cobbler with vanilla ice cream!! In the summer---even a perfect size for floats or putting on bananas for splits. So much handier for all ages than the ones with flavors (ie strawberry or chocolate) mixed in--those just don't go with everything like plain vanilla!!!
61_breyers,twinkieluv,2018-06-21,4,nostalgia,0,0,These remind me of the old school ice creams you get in school with the small wooden spoons. Takes me back to when I was little. I definitely love these simple creamy flavors and love the small portion size when you need to control your kids sweets intake. I got this product free to try but definitely adding to my future grocery lists.
61_breyers,Commander_Redhead,2018-06-27,5,Always a favorite!,0,0,"I received a coupon for a complimentary Breyers ice cream product for testing and of course I chose vanilla!! This was my favorite ice cream as a child and I wanted to share it with my kids, too. It's still a favorite! Great vanilla taste, smooth and creamy, just as wonderful as I remember!"
61_breyers,DMOINNY,2019-12-05,1,Vanilla Snack Cups Something Other Than Ice Cream,0,0,Have been enjoying your chocolate snack cups and then switched to vanilla as a change. Bad choice. The vanilla cups were grainy rather than smooth and the product actually would stick to the spoon. The product came out of the cup in chunks as if it was frozen but it wasn't.

61_breyers,Mama3,2018-06-23,5,Best vanilla ice cream,0,0,I've always loved this ice cream because of the real flavor and didn't think it could get better. But not having it in small cups is great to. Also #gotitfree from #influenster makes it even better.
61_breyers,Deliciousvanilla,2018-07-04,5,Who can resist classic vanilla,0,0,Thanks to influenster I got to get this product for free and boy was I glad I did. Who can resist classic vanilla? It tastes great and you can add any topping you want to switch it up.

62_breyers,Mel19,2017-09-14,1,No Blondie,6,1,The butterscotch flavor is good but there are no blondie chunks in the entire tub of ice cream. Not a single one! Very disappointed
62_breyers,Froglady,2018-04-13,5,The Best Has Arrived,2,0,"I am addicted to Butterscotch Blondie. My friend was going to the store and asked if I needed something, and I told her yes my Bryers Butterscotch Blondie. She called me from the store and said they were out of it. Did I want some other flavor, I said no, nothing but my Butterscotch Blondie. I would accept nothing else, so she quit asking. I said thank you, but I'll wait. I love it, I love it, I love it."
62_breyers,Emily,2018-12-27,1,"Wow, Bad!",2,1,"I haven't had Breyers since I was a kid and the quality is totally different than I remember. My brain and taste buds don't even recognize this as ice cream. The soft, fluffy and smooth texture is like eating whipped topping. I can't taste the milk/cream flavor that is present in most all ice creams, instead it's just super sweet. The entire thing comes off as highly artificial chemical goo. I like the texture of the blondies but they taste weird on their own."
62_breyers,Thedude77,2017-08-20,5,"Smooth, rich delight",2,0,"Bryers has done it again, a beautiful symphony of butterscotch and ice cream. It's a marvelous blend I bought on a hot day on a whim. This will not disappoint your pallet for sure!"
62_breyers,han32,2017-08-29,5,The bits of blondie make it even greater!!,2,0,This flavor is truly amazing. It tastes so delightful and I just can't get over the bites of blondie in it. My new fav!
62_breyers,Nisha,2018-01-19,5,This flavor exceeded my expectations,1,0,I am in love with it....only thing I would suggest is more blondie pieces throughout the ice cream...it really makes my mouth light up with delight when I discover a piece of soft gooey blondie mixed with the creamy goodness of butterscotch. This is your best flavor yet...I never EVER write reviews but this flavor was so magical to me to the point where I felt like you all needed to know. Great job Breyers!
62_breyers,Mentok302,2020-05-23,5,Absolute perfection,0,0,This is by far my favorite flavor ice cream EVER! For older people with weaker teeth that want a multi flavored ice cream with some substance in it it is perfect. Most ice creams of the sort either half nuts or chocolate chips which ruin the experience. This has soft blondie junks that are easy to chew. With butterscotch and blondies being 2 of my favorite sweets this is easily on my Mt. Rushmore of ice creams. I was buying 2 sometimes 4 a week until my local supermarket discontinued it.
62_breyers,Jimothy,2018-09-26,3,Needs more butterscotch,1,0,"The ice cream is ok, but I was disappointed with the lack of butterscotch flavor. It's there with bites of the blondies, but it's too faint. Still good, just not what I was hoping for."
62_breyers,Lindasscrap,2017-12-16,1,I tasted no butterscotch what so ever!,1,0,I was excited I love butterscotch this was such a let down. Yes it was vanilla but not even a good vanilla. tasted like frozen whipped cream.

62_breyers,Southernaries,2018-02-19,4,Great Taste,1,0,Creamy butterscotch taste. A blondie in each bite. Add pecans for a extra treat.
62_breyers,RTMike,2018-05-12,5,Butterscotch,1,0,Sometimes hit or miss on amount of chunks but ooooh so tasty!
62_breyers,Jim90,2018-01-11,2,NOT A WOW,1,1,"Flavor needs to catch up to the products identity.. Butterscotch flavor needs improvement, otherwise it's just a plain creamy vanilla with ""Blondie"" chuncks (???)"
62_breyers,Anonymous,2017-10-14,4,My review of the butterscotch blondie,1,1,The blondie pieces are good. It's on the sweeter side tho.
62_breyers,Marv,2019-10-17,5,Delicious,0,0,I've been trying to find this ice cream for the past few weeks. It's been taken out of all the stores near me. I loved this flavor and it was 10x better when I made it into a milkshake. Please put it back in stores around the Kentuckiana area.
62_breyers,Brh31690,2017-09-11,2,Incorrectly Named,0,0,"Butterscotch flavor is actually great. But calling it ""Butterscotch Blondie"" is a outrageous. There were 3 pieces of blondie in the ENTIRE quart. So incredibly disappointed because the two pieces I ate personally were delicious."
62_breyers,SReed,2018-08-01,1,No butterscotch flavor!,0,0,Very very disappointed. Should not use butterscotch in the name as it has zero butterscotch taste and even the Blondie pieces are bland. Terrible & not up to usual Breyers quality.
62_breyers,Teea,2019-01-21,4,Butterscotch Fan,0,0,"I love butterscotch candy and pudding. There is just enough butterscotch flavor and plenty of blondie pieces, it was just a little too sweet."

63_breyers,TankzMa,2017-07-05,5,Great taste in a great size,9,0,"I am always checking out the smaller packages of ice cream because I like the automatic portion control. Unfortunately, I'm picky so I struggle to find something I like. Today I was in the frozen foods and looked over and saw something I hadn't seen before, mini Breyers. I was a little disappointed when I thought they only came in vanilla, but then I saw the chocolate! It was a slam dunk right into my card.
When I was checking out, the woman at the register was surprised to see them come through, she had no idea they existed. She loves Breyers; I wouldn't be surprised if she stopped in the frozen foods aisle herself today.
The chocolate is great as ever; and the size was perfect! Thank you for creating something I never knew I wanted.:)"
63_breyers,BellaMay,2017-08-31,4,Almost Perfect,3,1,"Classic chocolate and vanilla in small single serving size. Great taste without overdoing it. Only two requests...Please include some wooden spoons in each pack (plastic spoons aren't as strong), and please do this size in Mint Chocolate Chip."

I wanted something sweet but not overwhelming. I found these today and just had one. It was amazing and guilt free at only 100 calories per cup!

63_breyers,Tennille,2018-06-27,5,Perfect serving size,0,0,Nothing is better than chocolate ice cream and these single serving size are perfect for my kids. No fighting over who got more with these ice cream snacks. And nothing beats the creamyness of Breyer’s.
63_breyers,Deann,2018-06-08,5,Great for kiddos,0,0,I love these snack cups. My 6 year old is a chocolate icecream addict! These are the perfect size for his nightly indulging and convenient for him and I so I don’t have to scoop out of a large tub!

63_breyers,TKDuncan,2018-06-08,5,So perfect for an independent little one!,0,0,"My daughter loves ice cream and is at the age where she is excited about things she can do independently. I love these little ice cream cups for her because they let her get her own treat out of the freezer and feel accomplished. I also love them because they are a fantastic size for her. Like most children, she tends to get overly enthusiastic when dishing out ice cream from a large container, and a lot goes to waste. With this product, she has exactly the right amount. I am not the type of person who purchases an obvious junk food and then complains that it's not ""healthy"" -- it's ice cream. It's not going to be a health food, and I'm fine with that. It's a treat! However, I was pleased to see that each little cup has fewer than 100 calories, and 5 grams of protein. That's fantastic for a child.
I'm vegan, so I didn't taste the ice cream. However, my daughter says it was delicious. She described it as creamy and thick, and the chocolate flavor was perfect. She's excited to get more sometime!
I received a coupon to redeem for a free container of this product from Influenster, and this review is my honest and willing opinion."

64_breyers,NardDog,2020-05-13,4,Powerful,7,0,"I agree with some reviewers that the cinnamon is not homogeneously distributed in every scoop, but it’s a nice taste. The Cinnabon dough bites add a kick of cinnamon and sugar. I wish they would put more dough bites in"
64_breyers,Ghost,2020-04-08,5,Amazing,5,0,"Amazing, would highly recommend. It's vanilla ice cream with dough bites and a cinnamon swirl throughout the ice cream. It is really sweet so if that's not your thing you might not like it."
64_breyers,Mc2003,2020-03-06,5,Great!,5,0,So good with lots of cinnamon roll bits throughout the center. It is lighter on bits around the edges and top but not by much. Very tasty!
64_breyers,IndianaGram,2020-02-19,2,Lacking enough flavor,8,4,"Not enough flavor throughout the container. The people who are the first to dive into the container basically get vanilla ice cream. When subsequent servings are served, you get more flavor but definitely not in every bite. I believe this happened once before with a new Breyer’s flavor. Disappointing"
64_breyers,MouseVb,2020-04-07,5,Wonderful flavor!,1,0,"This is a smooth, creamy vanilla ice cream with just the perfect hint of cinnamon goodness. Not too sweet but oh so good. I will definitely buy this again. I can’t wait to serve this on top of apple pie or even a coffee cake. Love the chewy mini cinnamon cups in this too. Just adds a little bit of texture and a whole lot of deliciousness! Love it. Thank you!!"
64_breyers,Kimber,2020-04-27,4,Acquired Taste,1,1,This ice cream definitely got my attention based off appearance. The fast however did not add up with what I was thinking. There was alot of cinnamon. In understand its a CINNAbon but way too much. The ice cream had a small hint of cinnamon but taste more like milk not even a hint of vanilla. I added graham crackers to mine to help add some texture. I can say i was expecting a bit more out of this. Still a great ice cream. I just have to jazz it up a bit to enjoy it.
64_breyers,CLT2525,2020-09-23,2,What happened to the dough bites and cinnamon?!,1,0,When I first had this ice cream it was loaded with dough bites and cinnamon and since then it has been different every time. No dough bites in the last few containers and barely any cinnamon! I’m surprised Cinnabon is putting their name on this. Honestly the new Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream is MUCH better. Disappointing.
64_breyers,Miss,2020-05-25,5,So good!!!!,2,1,"This is now my favorite ice cream! I don’t eat too much ice cream, but now... this is my go to whenever I crave it!"
64_breyers,Guinness,2020-09-24,1,Major disappointment.,0,0,"This is a mediocre creation. I'm a fan of Cinnabon, but this ice cream is an insult to it. Vast quantities of flavorless (no vanilla, nothing) white ice cream with occasional bits of cinnamon-flavored pellets about which nothing favorable can be said. The carton claims the ice cream has ""dough"" in it, yet there is nothing that can be reliably identified as such. Avoid at all costs."
64_breyers,TACNLV,2020-04-28,5,Cinnabon is my sin!,0,0,"My sister told me about Cinnabon so I bought some. I just happen to have baked a Marie Calendar’s Dutch Apple pie. So I cut a slice of pie, dropped on a nice scoop of Cinnabon ice cream and I was in love. They complemented each other very well. Only problem now is I am out of pie! But love my Cinnabon."
64_breyers,OpaC,2020-04-01,1,"Yeah cinnabuns, not really",0,2,"Have you ever had too much sugar in a cinnabun? Not likely. You'll get that here. Along with the lack of cinnamon.

64_breyers,BBrown,2020-05-20,5,My favorite!,0,0,This is one of my favorite Breyers flavors. You get the cinnamon swirls and textured dough pieces so it’s really a great product when you think of a Cinnabon ice cream.
64_breyers,Arthurj,2020-04-11,1,Very little flavor poor mouthfeel,0,1,This is ice milk rebranded. In no way does it approach the flavor or texture of ice cream. Find something else to buy. You will be disappointed with this product.

65_breyers,AkMack01,2020-09-12,4,Recommend,0,0,I love these!! But I guess because of COVID we can only find she fudge in our area. One store here carried the caramel but they’ve been out and aren’t getting any. Never even seen the mint but looks delicious!! Wondering when they are going to be in more stores and sell other flavors!! But in the mean time we’ll enjoy the fudge ones!!
65_breyers,itsanareviewed,2020-09-21,5,,0,0,"Absolutely delicious treat if you are on a low carb or keto diet. The Breyers brand ice cream is the closest thing I have found to actual ice cream for being on a low carb diet. ￼ obviously it’s not as rich as typical ice cream, but it taste very good compared to other flaky unsavory low-carb and keto ice cream options.￼"

66_breyers,Ssk13,2020-10-03,1,Missed the flavor,0,0,"Missed the flavor of s’more. No marshmallow flavor, chocolate very light- the graham crumb bites were good, overall very disappointed as this was really a splurge"
66_breyers,KO04,2020-04-25,5,New favorite!,3,0,"Based on previous reviews, it seems a few didn't like it, but I personally did. It is actually one of my new favorite flavors so far. Have been trying to find a smores ice cream that was actually good since my favorite smores ice cream were discontinued by another company a few years ago. New favorite is this one now!"
66_breyers,Mom of 4,2020-06-11,1,Disappointing,1,0,S’mores flavored is cream is one of my favorites. Brewers usually has great quality and therefore yummy ice cream so I was excited to see this flavor in the store. This version is very disappointing. The marshmallows are really gross-weird textures-almost like stale hard mini marshmallows you threw in your ice cream. The Graham was almost non existent but that’s ok since it also was off in texture and flavor. Try again Brewers but maybe go for a marshmallow cream swirl and chocolate covered Graham cracker pieces.
66_breyers,Marissa,2020-04-07,1,It doesnt taste like s'mores at all.,5,1,I was really looking forward to this ice cream but its actually gross. It tastes like really strong cinnamon and cardboard. :(
66_breyers,Anthony,2020-04-16,1,horrible,3,1,"I love ice cream and saw this at the store so I figured I would try S'mores along with the Peach cobbler. I tried the S'mores first, along with my family, and it was awful. taste nothing like S'mores. The graham cracker was grainy, marshmallows tasted like vanilla frosting. Will NOT buy again."
66_breyers,Ziggie,2020-04-09,1,No good unfortunately,3,1,Marshmallows are chalky while the graham cracker piece does leave a lot to be desired. Please try again I would gladly give it another try when the contents are changed.
66_breyers,smores connoisseur,2020-08-30,1,Such a disappointment!,0,0,"I usually love anything and everything s'mores so I was excited to try this new flavor!! Although, after 1/2 a bite, I was disgusted!! The vanilla and graham cracker part tasted like coconut and cinnamon. (Ingredients list oatmeal and ""spices"" in this part.) The chocolate part with ""marshmallow flavored pieces,"" tasted awful!! It would have been so much better with actual marshmallows (or even marshmallow creme)! This tastes nothing like s'mores and I'm saddened they're giving people the wrong impression of such a delicious treat!"
66_breyers,anjou,2020-08-14,1,Yuck,1,0,This is so bad we may just throw it out... can't say anything good about it..didn't taste like s'mores.. chocolate barely chocolatey. who knows what the middle flavor was.. this was nasty Very disappointed.. Breyers usually has good flavors.. this will go in the trash.. not worth the calories..
66_breyers,Emmalou,2020-05-04,1,No graham cracker,2,1,This ice cream is not even close to a s’more. Way too much little tiny chewy marshmallow pieces and no crunch graham crackers. The marshmallows have an odd taste. They could have done so much better with a classic summer desert. Really bad!
66_breyers,Ashes,2020-03-10,1,IS NOT GOOD,3,5,"THIS REVIEW DOES NOT VIOLATE GUIDELINES. The ice cream does not taste good. Wouldnt reccomend to anybody.
Calling to complain about how reviews are ""moderated"" if they are negative. That is bias and not true to this being a fair review. Not ever buying breyers again, and spreading the word about the company misconduct."
66_breyers,Julie,2020-09-09,1,Sorry I tried it. Won't buy this again!,0,0,I am disappointed with the S'mores ice cream. The chocolate ice cream should have a stronger chocolate flavor. The graham crackers in the white ice cream (What flavor is the white ice cream suppose to be?) had a funny tastes to them. I recommend you cover the graham cracker pieces in chocolate and make the white ice cream a strong vanilla flavor. I won't buy this flavor again.
66_breyers,Marian742,2020-09-19,5,Taste like the campfire version,0,0,Saw these in the freezer section thought I would give it a try since I do like s'mores. These really do taste like the campfire ones. Not too overly sweet which is nice but tasty never the same. Even the Grands liked this flavor. This has become a new favorite in my house.
66_breyers,mellrocks,2020-09-25,4,,0,0,"I thought this was pretty good. Its not super heavy or creamy, which I like. I saw another reviewer state that it was weird and didnt really taste like smores, which my boyfriend also said; but I didnt get that at all. Not my favorite ice cream, but Id buy it again."
66_breyers,Kirsten77,2020-09-22,1,Weird flavors,0,0,"We were so excited to try the S’mores ice cream. Ugh! Super disappointed! We thought the marshmallows were actually soggy, cinnamon-flavored graham cracker pieces. I had to spit them out to decipher what they were. This ice cream doesn’t taste like S’mores AT ALL."
66_breyers,Painful,2020-06-27,1,Disappointing,0,0,Sounded good but it wasn’t. Nothing like a S’more. The ice cream isn’t creamy. I tasted coconut but didn’t notice it in the ingredients. The marshmallows are a very odd texture and taste. What graham cracker? This isn’t Breyer’s standards.
66_breyers,Brianna,2020-09-25,5,Best Ice Cream I've eating in my 32 years of life,0,0,I love ice cream and I love s'mores. I have eaten my fair share of both. This is one of the rare ice creams that lives up to it's name. Deliciousness in every bite. Buy this or you will be disappointed.

66_breyers,Anonymous,2020-07-07,3,Disappointing. No Marshmallow taste,0,0,"Like the title says, I like marshmallow and found no test of it in this ice cream. The chocolate ice cream must be milk, because it lacked chocolate intensity. The graham bits were not great."

67_breyers,Eliza79,2020-04-26,5,My favorite flavor,2,0,This is so good! I wouldn’t change anything but the color of the peach icecream is a little too orange like an orange-sicle. It’s not becoming for how wonderfully natural the flavor it! The cobbler pieces are like eating real homemade crust from cobbler. The peach bits are ripe and densely sweet. I love the contrast of flavors with the peach and cream flavors. I WISH THIS WAS NOT LIMITED EDITION :(.
67_breyers,catmom,2020-09-05,1,Disappointed,5,1,I order my groceries online and had ordered Breyers Peach Ice Cream. They substituted Breyers Peach Cobbler. Much prefer for the regular Bryers Peach for taste. This just did not have the peach taste.
67_breyers,treasurelyfe,2020-03-27,5,OMG it's the BEST!,5,2,I don't think in my 39 years of living that I have ever written a review on ice cream. This ice cream is the best I've ever tasted! I had no idea it was called layer dessert when I was in the grocery store I just saw breyers and I saw peach cobbler and I bought it. If you love peach cobbler and ice cream you will love this!
67_breyers,Icecreame4life,2020-03-29,5,Surprisingly Great!,4,1,"I bought this on a whim. This is one of the best ice cream flavors I have eaten. For someone that eats ice cream all the time I will say that this is amazing. It has cobbler pieces as, well as peaches in it. I hope this stays as a permanent flavor!"
67_breyers,Laur,2020-04-24,5,The BEST ICE CREAM EVER!,2,0,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make this a regular item and not limited edition. I’m obsessed with this ice cream. I eat it every day!!
67_breyers,Justpeachy08,2020-06-03,5,Love peach ice cream,1,0,I have loved peach ice cream for years ! One dellivery company retired it and I’ve had a few others but this Brewers peach is really good ! Could use a little more peach flavor and peaches but otherwise don’t change anything else .. please keep this in the freezer section to be enjoyed year round !
67_breyers,Kattilac,2020-04-24,5,My new favorite! Perfect for spring/summer,1,0,Very natural peach flavor with a creaminess to it. My favorite is the middle vanilla creme section with doughy bits of undercooked pie dough. I wish Breyers would make just the creamy dough by itself. This will be a regular in my freezer. I hope it's not seasonal.
67_breyers,DeVinlove2017,2020-04-22,5,Breyers peach cobbler ice cream,1,0,This is actually my favorite ice cream ever!! I absolutely love the shortbread cookie part of it!! I also loved the flavor of the peach part too. I will most definitely keep on purchasing this if it keeps on coming out.
67_breyers,Sue29,2020-05-15,2,I didnt enjoy it,2,1,too much shortbread flavor the peaches were not good.
67_breyers,DIXIEMAMA72,2020-04-07,5,Pleasant surprise,2,2,Sometimes peach does not taste natural. But this has real peaches it has like a gram cracker type crust it was amazing we both love it peach is my favorite pie margaritaria fruits moonshine everything and this did not disappoint
67_breyers,Angie3006,2020-06-10,1,Not what I thought it would be,1,1,"I thought this would be bits of actual peach cobbler swirled in vanilla ice cream, NOPE! it's a combination of peach & vanilla ice cream with bits of peaches. I was expecting to get the effect of a scope of vanilla ice cream on top of my peach cobble, I wanted to taste the cobbler/crust in the vanilla. This was a bust!"
67_breyers,Roadjack,2020-04-22,1,Worst ice cream I’ve ever had,2,2,The peaches are not spiced and the “cobbler” tastes like raw dough. The this is the farthest from peach cobbler I could imagine.
67_breyers,XMan,2020-05-14,3,needs more peach flavor,1,1,I'm a long time buyer of the Peach ice cream and was hoping it would be that plus the typical cobbler ingredients. This seems to have much less peach flavor and bits to it. I can definitely taste the shortbread but it seems to diminish the peach.
67_breyers,PEACHLESS,2020-08-16,1,Worst ice cream ever!!!!!,0,0,"Tried Peach cobbler for the first time since we found some other Breyer's flavors enjoyable.
We found no peaches, no cobbler, and no flavor. But did find a baseball size empty hollow space toward the bottom.
Can't express our disappointment more strongly. After reading some of the other reviews, we see we are not the only ones feeling that way.
Breyers needs to develop a better recipe for this flavor."
67_breyers,Savagirl,2020-06-20,1,Fake flavor,1,1,"I just bought the peach cobbler ice cream, and normally I love breyers, but this wasa so gross I actually threw it away. The vanilla was fine, but the peach had a terrible fake taste and after taste"
67_breyers,jackie loves her dog,2020-06-01,1,Very disappointing. No flavor.,1,1,The peach portion had no peach flavor and the shortbread portion had no shortbread. Will definitely not buy again. I threw the whole thing out - not worth the calories.
67_breyers,Chrissy,2020-09-23,1,It hurts peach cobbler feelings,0,0,I love peach cobbler and ice cream but this was nothing even reminiscent of it. I should have read the description first before purchasing because it was pretty tasteless. The only thing decent was the shortbread cookies. I barely had any peaches in mine and the peach flavored ice cream became worse the more you ate it.
67_breyers,Hagis,2020-08-01,1,Yuck,0,0,"The moment I opened the carton I knew I'd made a mistake, the decidedly artificial coloring was a dead giveaway. How is orange even remotely peach like? On what planet to peaches look like that? The flavor matched the artificial color. I'll probably just toss the carton in the trash, it's that bad."
67_breyers,lindylou,2020-07-30,2,Peach Cobbler and Brownie Cheesecake Ice Cream,0,0,"I have tried both of these limited ice cream flavors and would not recommend them. The flavors are Ok but nothing to make me want to purchase them again. They are expensive for what they are. With he peach, there was way more cobbler than peach. They are ok but nothing to recommend."
67_breyers,taytay,2020-08-30,2,peach cobbler ice cream,0,0,I bought the icecream yesterday at walmart after seeing it online a few weeks ago. before that I had never heard of the kind.It taste ok. I prefer the regular peach icecream by breyers for that rich sweet peach taste. would I buy this kind again? probably not.
67_breyers,foderboder,2020-09-04,1,Horrible tasting,0,0,"I ate this the first night, and felt ill the next day. The peach flavor was off, brackish.
So I decided to eat only the white center. It was lacking taste, but I didn't feel as sick. I think the peaches were the casue of the ill feeling."

68_breyers,DisappointedMomma05,2020-08-16,3,Used to be a family favorite.,4,0,"So my family would buy 2 containers a week of this particular flavor at one point. Over time we noticed he flavors were becoming more and more bland, and then the most recent time we purchased it, there was not a SINGLE SOLITAIRY piece of brownie or cheesecake in the mix. All honesty, the cheesecake pieces and ice cream didn't really taste like cheesecake, and the chocolate ice cream itself has even become bland and flavorless at this point anyways. But still, the pieces of brownie and cheesecake pieces themselves were almost the whole point of us buying this instead of spending our money on the overpriced Ben & Jerry's. Now it's looking like we may have to. Hopefully Breyer's is willing to do something about this problem. Fix in some way."
68_breyers,RippedOff,2020-05-30,1,Surprised,5,0,Brownie Cheesecake is terrible. I’m surprised. It’s just 2/3 chocolate ice cream with 1/3 weird cheesecake ice cream. There are no chunks of brownie or cheesecake at all. Certainly not like the picture on the box at all.
68_breyers,Cadera,2020-03-31,1,Does not taste like brownies or cheesecake.,3,1,"This is a disappointment to me from Breyer's. None of the ice cream in this concoction has flavor. The pieces put in both the chocolate and cheesecake parts do not taste good at all. I can't even describe it. Breyer's needs to pull this one and work on it some more. Not up to par with the quality of their other flavors, for example chocolate truffle. The Cinnabon ice cream itself is delicious, however the ""bun"" pieces in it leaves a little to be desired. Both carbsmart ice creams are delicious, and so on. The Brownie Cheesecake is the first that I have not cared for because of the lack of proper flavoring."
68_breyers,TLDR,2020-05-19,4,Almost Perfect!,1,1,The flavors and chunks of brownie / cheesecake really do taste wonderfully individually. Together they seem a bit off? I would rather buy them individually. A chocolate ice cream with Brownie Chunks and a plain Cheesecake with real chunks of cheesecake in it without added Strawberry or Chocolate swirls would both be awesome. It would free me up to buy the separate squeeze bottles of topping to add to my palette or not at all. In quarantine I find Breyers to be a childhood comfort that I am grateful to still afford. I would definitely be interested in seeing these two flavors in their own cartons as future options even if only limited to summer time.
68_breyers,Bluecarguy,2020-04-14,2,Missing the brownie & cheesecake pieces,3,1,"When grocery shopping, I was in the mood for ice cream with brownies, and I found this, but to my disappointment, this ice cream was very much lacking any brownie or cheesecake pieces, so sad."
68_breyers,Elle297,2020-03-04,1,The worst flavor,2,1,"This was a waste of money. My mom bought this flavor to surprise me on my period and It’s bland, boring and honestly? A waste of calories. Do better breyers. Do better."
68_breyers,Court,2020-06-16,1,Mistake in production chocolate isn’t chocolate,2,0,This would have been amazing but the chocolate ice cream tastes and looks nothing like chocolate. It tasted awful. There must be a production mistake because it doesn’t even look like the picture. I would upload a picture but it won’t load. Essentially it looks like vanilla with a tint of beige
68_breyers,caeser,2020-08-28,2,Not what I was hoping for,1,0,"We really love the cheesecake version of a competitive ice cream brand. Was really hoping Breyers version would be equally good. We were very disappointed - no one in our family liked it. Didn't notice any cheesecake chunks, not creamy (and we noticed this was a frozen dairy dessert - not ice cream). The flavor was artificial to us. We were so bummed and I hope they can improve this. We tried to eat it twice and just ended up throwing it away."
68_breyers,Darling Girl,2020-04-02,3,"Cheesecake is amazing, brownie is fine",1,1,"The cheesecake flavor is my absolute favorite. It's so good and cheesecake bites give it good texture. The brownie flavor is just fine. It's brownie ice cream. I can't understand for the life of me why anyone would choose to have two sections of brownie and only one section of cheesecake. It should be reversed at least, if not scrap the whole brownie flavor and just have a classic cheesecake flavor. (As opposed to the newyork style which has strawberry which I don't care for.)"
68_breyers,Terezia,2020-07-06,1,Terrible flavor,1,0,Cheesecake and brownies are my two favorite desserts. I was over the moon to see this in the store and to be able to get it as a birthday treat for myself. It was so terrible and disappointing. The ice cream tasted very watered down while the brownie and cheesecake pieces all we’re very bland. It was a serious let down.
68_breyers,GO134,2020-03-28,5,Chocolate brownie Cheesecake flavor perfect!,0,1,Breyers you got this one right I bake cheesecakes and you got the flavor down pat I can even taste lemon in the mixture a must in cheesecake batter! The chocolate brownie mix flavor is delicious brownie chunks yum! I like to add pineapples and coconut flakes to my bowl my taste buds go wild Thanks Breyers this one is a hit please keep this flavor!
68_breyers,Tela,2020-04-02,5,Simply Delicious,0,0,Oh my! What a wonderful combination of flavors. I must say this is one of my favorite combinations....2 delicious treats in one. The cheesecake/brownies pieces are so flavorful and rich. If I had to use one word to sum up this ice cream I would say decadent.
